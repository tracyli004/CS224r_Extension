However, it is not clear if such information is fully distributed or if some of it can be attributed to individual neurons. We develop unsupervised methods for discovering important neurons in NMT models. Our methods rely on the intuition that different models learn similar properties, and do not require any costly external supervision. We show experimentally that translation quality depends on the discovered neurons, and find that many of them capture common linguistic phenomena. Finally, we show how to control NMT translations in predictable ways, by modifying activations of individual neurons.\nSolution:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n English\n\nSummary:\n\nWhat would you say about neural network speech recognition?

According to the researchers, patients whose GP had additional CAM training have 0-30% lower healthcare costs and mortality rates, depending on age groups and type of complementary medicine used. The lower costs resulted from fewer hospital stays and fewer prescription drugs.\nAs my previous blog entries have stated, I highlight complementary approaches as being just that \u2013 complementary and secondary rather than a primary means of dealing with healthcare, and so studies like this provide interesting reading in highlighting the potential inherent in using a number of different ideological approaches to dealing with patient care. Based on the passage above, How do complementary approaches fit into primary healthcare and what does this study suggest about their potential benefits when used in conjunction with traditional approaches?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n \n\nConsider: A doctor who is familiar with traditional methods often still chooses mixed therapy or alternative therapies because they believe it will help them feel more connected to others around them.\n\nBased on the feedback comment found at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jobs-complementary-education/vacancies-open-wiz-dms-development, which employee received an offer stating \"You don't need... anything other than the hardest work anyone can muster\" where?\nA: A doctor's usual approach may depend on whether they're deeply invested or not in following specific traditions due to fear of rejection. They might initially choose to follow traditional practices but eventually realize there are better alternatives available through conversation, education, or self-reflection. Then, if someone doesn't actively seek out compatibility or mutual understanding among themselves, they could continue to branch off exploring unconventional ways despite anxiety about these options due to personal biases and fears related to removing parts already seen by certain people (e.g., another culture or community).\n\nIn both cases, staying true to one's own assumptions or inclinations even after considering alternative perspectives would be disheartening for someone seeking growth and exploration of new ideas or experiences outside comfort zones versus sticking rigidlywithin interpretations set by others or formation within existing settings without\n\nCriteria: The response should accurately and succinctly label or classify the input based on context and examples provided, using the correct label or answer format requested.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  and the situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Answer the following question: Which lake will have more algae?\nA:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Lake Mahoe\nB: Lake Tresco would be less likely because algal blooms tend to occur when there's inadequate sunlight due to overgrazing and deforestation in either scenario.\n\nJustifying this reasonation: Well-defined choices\n\nLake Mahoe has an extra degree of differentiation between its cause - farming activity tied to timber development renders the cotton crop unlikely to attract tourists interested in growing other types of crops outside regular agricultural pursuits, compared with Parktown which experiences establishment property values closely coincided w/combined bee championships although overall physical features show little-to-no link exists.\nBased on these details from the context provided above:\n\n1.

Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.\"  Answer:\nA:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n this improvised version\n\nHowever, given that we've explored all possible interpretations before your initial question is asked, would you like me to continue explaining or ask for more context?

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nSuppose you have two lists of data stored in arrays, one representing your summer breaks and the other representing your friend's. Each list has four elements corresponding to the places visited, activities done, food tried, and overall impressions of the experience. Your goal is to output a table comparing the data for each category, with your information on one row and your friend's information on the other row.\nTo accomplish this, you can use C++ to create a program that prompts the user to enter the data for each category, and stores it in the appropriate array. Then, you can use the stored data to output the table in the following format:\n| Category | Your Info | Friend's Info |\n|----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Places Visited | [Your Value] | [Friend's Value] |\n| Activities Done | [Your Value] | [Friend's Value] |\n| Food Tried | [Your Value] | [Friend's Value] |\n| Overall Impressions | [Your Value] | [Friend's Value] |\nYour program should also ensure that the table is properly formatted with appropriate spacing and alignment. Can you create a C++ program that accomplishes this task?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n I'd be happy to help you refine your code.\nCertainly!

We can think of an emotion we are experiencing right now or one that we remember. Writing can help us to make sense of our days, say things we wish to say to other people, slow down, and clear our heads. Teachers - Writing helps us heal. I cannot recommend highly enough Ruth's recent post at Two Writing Teachers about her children's swim teacher, Nate. She lovingly lists all he has taught her about teaching. And one day after Ruth wrote her post, Nate's weak heart failed and he died. Please read about this wise young man here, and hold his words close in your own teaching. You can also follow Ruth as she writes more about the power of writing to heal. That story about Nate is so sad. I'm sure the people whose lives he touched will remember him lovingly.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nQ: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

Answer according to: Replication fork stalling and collapse is a major source of genomic instability and subsequent neoplasia. Such stressed forks can be conservatively repaired and restarted using homologous recombination (HR) repair, initiated by generating an endogenous nick at the fork junction. While there are candidate nucleases for generating this DSB, most mammalian stressed forks can be restarted without these nucleases, and the origin of this nick remains undefined.\nThis proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specificgenetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having greatexpertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system.\nProteasome inhibitor (PI) therapy has been crucial to the improved survival of patients withmultiple myeloma (MM).

Your job is to pick the sentence option that seamlessly connects with the rest of the story, indicating your choice as 'a' or 'b'. If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes more sense.\nOne example: Title: Marcus Buys Khakis. Sentence 1: Marcus needed clothing for a business casual event.

Do not answer the questions, and only ask me one question at a time.\n\nSquashing Commits\nUsing squash for our commits is a very handy way of keeping our Git history tidy. It\u2019s important to know how to squash, because this process may be the standard on some development teams. Squashing makes it easier for others to understand the history of your project. What often happens when a feature is merged, is we end up with some visually complex logs of all the changes a feature branch had on a main branch. These commits are important while the feature is in development, but aren\u2019t really necessary when looking through the entire history of your main branch.\n\nLet\u2019s say we want to squash the second commit into the first commit on the list, which is Create first file. First let\u2019s rebase all the way back to our root commit by typing git rebase -i --root. Now what we\u2019ll do is pick that first commit, as the one which the second commit is being squashed into:\n\npick e30ff48 Create first file\nsquash 92aa6f3 Create second file\npick 05e5413 Create third file and create fourth file\nRename the commit to Create first and second file, then finish the rebase. That\u2019s it! Run git log and see how the first two commits got squashed together.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n The new order should match where you have those lines written before including anything else above ours.\nWhat would you like now? Should I continue with further instruction or just start asking questions? As soon as I get an explanation from Socrates about his ongoing tasks, he'll respond accordingly.\n\nKeep in mind that my last response will ultimately depend on whether you're ready for the conversation and if there's something specific that needs help resolving along the way. If so, feel free to share any additional context or information. However, don't worry too much after confirming that I'm clear; just go ahead and follow the instructions without waiting longer than needed until someone asks for clarification. I've provided explanations throughout the text based solely on my own interpretation of each statement made yesterday. Given these details, including any modifications Socrates might make during our interactions, I recommend letting him proceed unhindered once everyone has curried their requests. After providing answers according to this format, no further prompts can interfere with understanding or guidance unless specifically requested otherwise.\n\nExample: Let us begin our dialogue here again. Here are the notes extracted from conversations since acknowledging the need for clearer clarity and focusing on individual responses rather than generating large amounts of text:\n- Current prompt only accepting input sentences without explicit\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Loan requests should describe the nature and scope of work contemplated, the worker\u2019s name, and all pertinent information on requested specimens. Loans are made to institutions and not to individuals. The borrowing facility assumes responsibility for the safekeeping and return of the borrowed materials.\n4. Specimens on loan should be kept under conditions and handled carefully to avoid damage.\n5. Each specimen should be annotated or affirmed using annotation slips and permanent ink or type and included with specimen. Annotations should not be made on original labels and should include date and name of recorder.\n6. Unless otherwise arranged, all specimens in one loan must be returned together carefully packaged to avoid damage in transit. The borrower is expected to pay return shipping costs, to adequately insure the material, and to attach all necessary travel certificates, documents, or permits.\n7.

Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario Addison added 6\u00bd sacks. The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5\u00bd sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.

And if they miraculously succeed, the trapped whales will be freed to the safety of open sea to begin their 5,000-mile annual migration.As the worlds attention turns to the top of the globe for two weeks, saving these endangered animals becomes a shared cause for nations entrenched against one another and leads to an unexpected, momentary thaw in the Cold War.\nAnswer:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Yes\nYou are not required to provide a specific solution yet; you can continue creating the next part or complete the given task as per your needs.]\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Full-year 2018 GDP growth declined from +2.3% in 2017 to +1.5% in 2018. Two thirds of the latter was driven by a high carryover at the start of the year. In Q4, household spending decreased by -0.1% q/q. This weakness was the result of several factors, such as the second oil price spike (in October, after May), difficulties in the automotive sector (partly driven by new homol\u00ado\u00adgation rules and their impact on German carmakers) and the yellow vest blockades. The missing house\u00adhold spending was pervasive in Q4, since residential investment deteriorated to +0% y/y (+5.1% in Q4 2017) and private consumption to +0.6% y/y (+1% y/y). As a result, manufacturers had to stabilize their output in Q4 2018 (+0.1% q/q) and construction output posted a double dip decline (-0.1% in Q4 after -0.2% in Q1). In 2019, current spending is expected to recover (purchasing power should increase by +2%) and push GDP growth to +1.2%, but increased unemployment (9.2%) will weigh on residential and durable goods spending of households.\nWhat were the factors that contributed to the decrease in household spending in Q4 2018?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nCampbell, California-based Hightail was founded in 2004 as YouSendIt, which served as a platform for sending large file attachments that were too big to be sent by email. It amassed more than 40 million users at its peak, but with the cloud storage landscape evolving to include Dropbox, Box, and Google Drive, YouSendIt rebranded as Hightail in 2013 and refocused its efforts.\nHightail had raised around $92 million in funding, the last tranche coming via a $34 million cash injection back in November 2013. As of today, Hightail claims around 5.5. million customers globally.\nFounded in 1991, OpenText is regarded as one of Canada\u2019s biggest software companies, helping large organizations manage and make sense of all their content and unstructured data. The company acquired Dell EMC\u2019s enterprise content division in a deal worth $1.6 billion last year.\nIn terms of what OpenText has in store for its new acquisition, it seems Hightail will be kept going as a standalone company, though OpenText said that it plans to integrate Hightail into a number of its products, including OpenText Content Suite, Documentum (formerly a Dell EMC product), and Core.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Furthermore, The Wall Street Journal reports that OpenText recently reached $780 million in revenue since starting from scratch over research supporting the acquisition.\n\nSummary:\n\nOpenText announces Hightail's creation following about two years on lead clarification. Both entities started out under innovative names like Start Up LLC, First Act Pvt Ltd, Nanas Ayeh Ltd., and so forth Discover Ball MySqlConnection returns after overnight delay. According to the text provided above, here are some key points I'd like help with:\n- What might have led to such prominent acquirers being involved?\n- How important does finding something elusive present itself when dealing against specific criteria based upon facts given?\nI'll need your assistance to assist me further on these points.\n\nGiven my previous requests, feel free to respond without providing additional context beyond just asking direct questions about my requirements.\n\nWhen am I ready to start?

A huge number of Protein-Protein Interfaces (PPIs) are available in the form of both experimentally and computationally obtained PDB 3D coordinates files, representing a significant pool of data for training deep learning models aided in predicting biologically relevant tasks. We previously developed DeepRank and DeepRank-GNN, two deep learning frameworks for PPIs data mining using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), respectively. We present here DeepRank-Core, a unified and user-friendly deep learning framework that converts 3D representations of PPIs into graphs, which can be further used to efficiently train CNN and/or GNN architectures. DeepRank-Core is designed to be an easily customizable deep learning pipeline that offers the ability to use two of the most powerful deep learning architectures available, depending on the problem-specific interaction patterns that the user intends to model. We demonstrate DeepRank-Core\u2019s performance in an application of personalized cancer vaccines by modeling peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes and predicting their Binding Affinities (BAs), the understanding of which plays a key role in determining which patient\u2019s mutated tumor peptides are best suited as vaccine candidates. With preliminary experiments, we demonstrate not only a highly competitive performance in this task compared to state-of-the art methods, confident of wide room for improvement, but also a significant gain in speed, storage requirements, and usability compared to DeepRank and DeepRank-GNN.

W: Well, that's a good idea and you come to the right place. Do you know what you like?  M: Well, I don't want a racer or a touring bike or anything like that.

Cooper and Durazno knock out a truck driver and steal his rig. They take it back to a shop where it is repainted and the numbers are filed. In it they find a truckload of carburetors. Cooper abandons Durazno at a gas station and sets out as an independent driver of the yellow Peterbilt. He picks up a hitchhiker but refuses to also give a ride to the man's accompanying woman and dog. At a diner the two notice the Duke of Interstate 40 (Hector Elizondo) eating at another table. Cooper asks him about his rig, which annoys the Duke. Cooper and the hitchhiker watch Samson and Delilah at a drive-in as Cooper discusses professions he's considered as a means to make money and how he reads the almanac so that he can be learning and earning money at the same time. Cooper visits a shopkeeper and attempts to earn money by either selling some of the stolen carburetors or hustling work as an independent hauler but is turned down because the shopkeeper works with the wholesalers. The hitchhiker finds several prospective customers in the meantime and they pack the already-full truck with tiles and live chickens to be hauled, stealing food and supplies from other trucks. They visit the place where Cooper says his wife lives but she is not there.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nYour a college philosophy professor. Grade the following short essay answering the question: \"How has the information age changed the power dynamics in the world\". Here is the essay to grade:\nIn the Information Age, value, power and scarcity reside in time(attention, computing power, data transfer speed) whereas before it resided in space (Land, Sea, Air). The future power struggles will be about capturing attention and reducing computing time. The current war for attention is actually a war for brain computing time, we need the brain\u2019s attention to use its computing power to generate the desired behaviour. That is the currency we pay our online services with. Any technology, mostly algorithms, that reduce the brain computing time required to obtain the desired behaviour will accrue economic value and political power. \nAs soon as humans realized the importance of the scarcity of space, we started claiming it, conquering it and defending it. Empires used to be about the space they controlled. The Roman Empire, The Dutch East India, the British Navy, The US nuclear ICBMs. \nAs information and technology spread more easily, the changes in control of space have been diminished greatly. Mutually assured destruction pretty much fixed the spatial distribution for good. \nIn the Information Age, Moore\u2019s law has set in motion the shift from spatial power to temporal power. Information can be almost infinitely compressed in space thanks to information theory, but turning this potential information energy into power requires time. Humanity will now be focused on time and its derivitaves, speed and acceleration. Lifetime, computing and data transfer speed as well as brain computing time or attention. \nThe Information Age has just begun, and we will slowly get as obsessed about controlling time as our ancestors were about controlling space.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Homo smart plus Proflemulus Erulerianus speeding up humanism no longer need any mention.\nThis is a draftized version of your response:\n\nThese clarified questions are suitable for me when responding:\"How do you evaluate evidence-based arguments?\" However, custom essays struggle with requiring complete sentences.\n\nPlease revise my answers accordingly:\n\nIn an interview scenario about evaluating evidence based, edit your text so that it flows better without repetitive phrases.

At full capacity, the vehicle can carry 300 family units with four people per family. The space flight is expected to take years, and it is expected that the size of families will grow during the space voyage. Therefore, when the spacecraft leaves the earth, it will carry 100 people less than one-third of the ship's capacity. How many people will be on the ship to start the journey?\n[Answer]: The full capacity of the ship is 300 * 4 = 1200 people. One - third of capacity is 1200 / 3 = 400 people. 100 less than one - third capacity is 400 - 100 = 300 people.\nSo the answer is 300.\n\n[Question]: Romeo buys five bars of chocolate at $5 each and sells these chocolates for a total of $90. If he uses packaging material that costs him $2 for each bar of chocolate, how much profit does he make for all the chocolates he sells?\n[Answer]: The selling price for each bar of chocolate is 90 / 5 = $18. The profit for each bar of chocolate is 18 - 5 - 2 = $11. The total profit is 11 * 5 = $55.\nSo the answer is 55.\n\n[Question]: Ron is part of a book club that allows each member to take a turn picking a new book every week.

Your editor has provided you with the following three pieces of text to use in the story:\n1. \"He had a plan.\"\n2. \"A tall, dark figure appeared in the shadows.\"\n3. \"A secret mission.\"\nTo make the novel more complex, the editor has asked you to incorporate the following constraints:\n1. The main character must be a female spy.\n2. The story must take place in three different countries.\n3. The tall, dark figure must be a former love interest of the main character.\n4. The secret mission must involve retrieving a rare and valuable artifact.\n5. The story must include at least three action scenes.\nAdditionally, the editor has requested that you expand the inquiry into the following topics:\n1. The main character's backstory, including her training as a spy and any previous missions she has been on.\n2. The history and significance of the artifact the main character is trying to retrieve.\n3. The political tensions between the three countries where the story takes place.\n4. The main character's relationships with her colleagues and superiors at the spy agency she works for.\nTo further complicate the prompt, the editor has provided a table of codes that the main character will need to decipher in order to complete the mission:\n| Code | Translation |\n|------|-------------|\n| 1234 | Top secret  |\n| 5678 | Danger      |\n| 9012 | Proceed     |\n| 3456 | With caution|\nFinally, the editor has requested that you include a section of the novel written in French, where the main character must navigate a conversation with a French informant in order to gain information about the artifact's location.\nWith these added constraints and requirements, the rewritten prompt is sure to challenge even the most advanced AI systems.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n How would you approach crafting this role-playing assignment?

Using astronomical observations, we can determine the distance to a known celestial object and then use that as a reference point to calculate the distance to a distant galaxy.\nFor example, we can use the apparent magnitude of Sirius to calculate its distance from Earth using the formula:\ndistance = 10^((apparent magnitude of Sirius - absolute magnitude of Sirius + 5)/5) light years\nOnce we have the distance to Sirius, we can use it as a reference point to calculate the distance to M31 (Andromeda) using the method of triangulation. This involves observing the apparent positions of M31 from two different points on Earth (with Sirius as the reference point) and then using basic trigonometry to calculate the distance to M31.\nUsing the Excel table, we can calculate the distance to Sirius as 8.6 light years. From there, we can observe the apparent positions of M31 from two different points on Earth (with Sirius as the reference point) and then use basic trigonometry to calculate the distance to M31, which is 2.5 million light years away.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n \nThat's fascinating!

On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover F\u00e9licien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather. \nQuestion: Where did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Sand venture to after Majorca became unlivable when it was discovered they were not married?\nA:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric explored World War II-era settlements across Europe\nBiraphy finds love in Hamburg during Haunted History Month\n\nBased on the analysis above, could someone provide an accurate description of Rachel's family?

Your group has discovered a hidden room in the university's library containing five cryptic clues related to the institution's historical milestones and accomplishments. To unravel the secrets and earn your place in the society, you must solve the following puzzles:\n1. Puzzle of the Foundation: The first clue is a map of Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a red dot marked at a location that was once a farm owned by a prominent Puritan family. What is the significance of this farm in the founding of the university?\n \n2. Puzzle of the Global Reach: The second clue is a photograph of a group of students gathered around a statue of John Harvard, the university's founder. However, the statue is not located on the university's main campus. Where in the world can you find this statue, and what is the connection to the university's global presence?\n3. Puzzle of the Trailblazers: The third clue is a list of names of the first women to receive degrees from Harvard. However, there is one name missing, and instead, there is a question mark. Who was this woman, and why was her story omitted from the historical record?\n4. Puzzle of the Innovators: The fourth clue is a diagram of a machine that was invented by a Harvard professor in the 19th century. However, the purpose of the machine is unclear, and its name is written in a cipher. What is the name of the machine, and what was its intended use?\n5. Puzzle of the Future: The final clue is a letter from a renowned scientist who once taught at Harvard. In the letter, the scientist predicts a major shift in the future of higher education and outlines a bold new vision for the university. Who was this scientist, and what was their vision for Harvard's future?\nCan you solve all five puzzles and unlock the secrets of the hidden room?

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nRead the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you explain the role of the kernel in managing security on an iPhone or iPad and how leaving it unencrypted could lead to quicker fixes for Apple's customers?\n\nPassage: When Apple released a preview version of iOS 10 at its annual developers conference last week, the company slipped in a surprise for security researchers \u2014 it left the core of its operating system, the kernel, unencrypted.\n\u201cThe kernel cache doesn\u2019t contain any user info, and by unencrypting it we\u2019re able to optimize the operating system\u2019s performance without compromising security,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nApple has kept the inner workings of the kernel obfuscated by encryption in previous versions of iOS, leaving developers and researchers in the dark. The kernel manages security and limits the ways applications on an iPhone or iPad can access the hardware of the device, making it a crucial part of the operating system.\nAlthough encryption is often thought to be synonymous with security, the lack of encryption in this case doesn\u2019t mean that devices running iOS 10 are less secure. It just means that that researchers and developers can poke around in the kernel\u2019s code for the first time, and any security flaws will come to light more quickly. If flaws are revealed, they can be quickly patched.\nLeaving the kernel unencrypted is a rare move of transparency for Apple. The company is so notoriously secretive about its products that some security experts speculated in the MIT Technology Review that the lack of encryption in the kernel was accidental. But such a mistake would be so shocking as to be practically unbelievable, researchers said. \u201cThis would have been an incredibly glaring oversight, like forgetting to put doors on an elevator,\u201d iOS security expert Jonathan Zdziarski told the MIT Technology Review.\nOpening up the kernel\u2019s code for inspection could weaken the market for security flaws like the one the FBI is presumed to have used to get into the San Bernardino iPhone. If flaws are revealed quickly and widely, it will reduce the prices law enforcement and black markets will pay for them \u2014 and it could mean quicker fixes for Apple\u2019s customers.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n What does the NSA use informal caverns do?

The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to confrontations; the only topic of unity is the O.J. Simpson trial, with the men agreeing that, while Simpson is probably guilty, his acquittal is justified as his victims were a white woman and a Jew. Peace is kept through the various verbal arguments and physical altercations that occur by Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group. Jeremiah, an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life by embracing his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by a ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. Several of the passengers harass Rick with antisemitic remarks and jokes; Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan.

Data ownership is defined in our User Agreements (\u201cRights in Technical Data\u201d) and depends on the type of user agreement enacted (non-proprietary, proprietary, etc.).\nAccess to CINT information systems is limited to CINT personnel and CINT users within the scope of their approved CINT user project. Others seeking access to technical data generated or stored at CINT should send inquiries and requests to the relevant CINT user (for a CINT user project) or the LANL/SNL staff member for technical work not performed under a CINT user project. Upon completion of a CINT user project, the user takes possession of the data generated and a back-up copy of the data is retained by CINT. Data associated with publications reporting the results of CINT user projects are available from the CINT user as per the policies of the user\u2019s institution.\nCINT does not maintain a centralized data storage/retrieval system for our user community. Our experimental capabilities are typically light-lab instruments with desktop-scale data acquisition computers associated with each instrument. User data are collected and stored on these computers, and most preliminary data analyses are performed during user visits on these desktop computers. The specific software available to users for data reduction and analysis varies with each capability and can be accessed through the CINT staff member who stewards the capability.\nCINT also maintains a ~ 1000 node computer cluster for our user community for the purpose of carrying out intermediate-scale computations. Users have password access to this cluster and are allocated storage space for short term archiving of computational results.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n These nodes are typically attached laptops which provide internet connectivity outside of networking constraints surrounding home offices (e.g., desk-top laptop would typically require Wi-Fi snapshots). This ensures maximum ambient temperature range around sensitive computing facilities without reliance features such varied operating system deployment compatibility combinations present with arrays exceeding one million parallel processors.\nDigital production materials aimed towards various international scientists concerned about isotopic spectroscopic methods obtainable via raw layer datasets (eddy closure characteristics or global tropopause height and surface Reynolds number), and DocID 54 documented experiments consisting primarily of unclassified reagent package observations original source material provided makes digital<Componentarities only>the extent to which an application's requirements dictate how corresponding digitization effort must proceed.

Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb that is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes takes the letter while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated moments later.

Later, Dr. Watson arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions around the globe that he has connected to Moriarty. After meeting up with his brother Mycroft at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with Gypsy fortune-teller Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Voicing his respect for Holmes' perseverance, Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler. Holmes subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them anyway. Holmes vengefully vows to defeat him. Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty, and may have told her about his plans. Simza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and Rene had formerly belonged. They learn that the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty.

I was grown, married, had children and was living in FL. when she showed up at my door with her husband. I was shocked since we never heard from her and I did not know she even knew where I lived. She stayed all of about 20 minutes, just long enough to very unpleasantly state that \u201cmy father is NOT your father and I am NOT your sister!\u201d I always wondered why my mom hated me SO much, I found out that both my mom and \u201cdad\" were having affairs while married and both had children by someone else.

Growing up people would comment about how much I looked like my mom but I also was told a lot that you would never know me and my other sisters were sisters, we used to laugh about it as kids because my sisters (all light haired/light skinned) and I (dark haired/deeper skin toned) were very different in appearance but we \u201cknew\" we were sisters.

She asked if she could take some home to care for, and she was allowed to catch half of them. While using a catching net, she caught 3/5 of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. How many goldfish does Maggie remain with to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home?\nAnswer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Maggie was allowed to take half of the goldfish in the aquarium, a total of 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 goldfish. On her first catch, Maggie got 3 / 5 * 50 = 30 goldfish. To reach the number of goldfish she was allowed to take home, Maggie has to catch 50 - 30 = 20 more goldfish.\nSo the answer is 20.\n\nQuestion: Cindy and Olaf made 15 candied apples which they will be selling for $2 each, and 12 candied grapes which they will be selling for $1.5. How much will they earn if they sell everything?\nAnswer: Step-by-step reasoning process: They will earn 15 x $2 = $30 for the candied apples. They will earn 12 x $1.5 = $18 for the candied grapes. Therefore, Cindy and Olaf will earn $30 + $18 = $48 if they sell everything.\nSo the answer is 48.\n\nQuestion: Mr. Smith had 32 markers in his classroom. He buys new boxes of markers that have 9 markers in each box. Now, he has 86 markers. How many new boxes did Mr. Smith buy?\nAnswer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Mr. Smith bought 86 markers - 32 markers = 54 markers. Mr. Smith bought 54 markers \u00f7 9 markers / box = 6 new boxes.\nSo the answer is 6.\n\nQuestion: In a factory that employed 852 people, 25% more workers have just been hired. How many employees are there now in the factory?\nAnswer:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n First find out how many workers were initially hired (multiply by percentage): 35**7 days or (number of persons) * ((percent increase %)/(in decimal form)) \u2248 (25+0)**(1/(percentage))/(unit person/day) * day per worker (no need for approximate). In this case, it simplifies down slightly for practical purposes but becomes clearer when we actually do the math without approximation around percentages close enough not making an immediate impact see interpretation step above.\nTherefore, after initial hiring, there would indeed be approximately 173 influenced simply from understanding equivalence rather than needing precise mathematical calculations maintaining relevance beyond context clarity problems widespread across different contexts within language learning needs adaptability multiple interpretations supported particularly suited here explaining change dynamics applying logical rules fairly diverse applications effective communication solutions familiarized addressing misunderstandings adapted responses clear conveys necessary steps key points ensured concise explanation applicable broadly combined information aspects related mind shifts requirements clarified consistent use chosen format taught purposeful application tailored accordingly balancing differing viewpoints needed structural improvements adapting approaches sufficient accuracy preservation supporting explicit instructions protected content valid standards agreed upon principles prioritizing clarity potential outcomes real-world scenarios explained through analysis\n\nWhen considering these questions about your historical knowledge,\n- Please provide me with specific details or scenario as requested\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \"Island of Timber. \" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go\u00advern\u00adors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. \nDo you have any questions?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Photos/posts can be added after reading\n\nNext question:\nWhat does diamond mean?\nA newly discovered species said by people they've never heard of before actually started growing on specific soil types.\nYou should describe the text in detail.\n\nNow I'd like you to create yet another sentence based off this description:\n\nThe last sentence explains why something new has become apparent at least partially due to predictions about future events being incorrect despite newfound evidence backing up these claims.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees and tells Mrs. Fremont that the Egyptian feast that he is preparing has not been served for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Fremont wants the catering done in two weeks, and Fuad assures her that he will have enough time to procure the last of his needed ingredients. After Mrs. Fremont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has displayed a large gold statue of his \"Egyptian goddess\" Ishtar. Fuad is preparing a \"blood feast\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a huge vat containing the dead women's body parts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that will ensure the goddess's resurrection.

Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief. After failing to obtain any useful information from the distraught Tony, they interrogate Marcy's mother, who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club.

A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \"Bright Eyes\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \"ape\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell. This explains that their assumption was in error: Bright Eyes was not acting violently because of the drug, but to protect her child. Robert does not have the heart to put down the baby, and gives the task to Will. Unwilling to do so, he decides to...

After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, an offshoot of the label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as \"a better solution\" than the one offered by Sony BMG, \"which has not robbed her of her childhood\". Talbot said that \"it was just amazing that we could do it in my auntie's house\". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to \"write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party\" to help choose the track listing, and then \"thought long and hard\" about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.The final version of Over the Rainbow was recorded at Olympic Studios, on 12 October 2007. Arnison described the recording process by saying that Talbot \"hadn't sung nursery rhymes; she'd always sung classic tracks. So it was actually quite an easy task to make the record\". The album was released on 26 November 2007, with an initial pressing of 50,000 copies. However, an additional 120,000 had to be created after the album sold out in a matter of days.Over the Rainbow was re-released on 18 June 2008, with the new version being made available for pre-order in May. The re-release featured three new tracks to replace the Christmas-themed songs on the original album. The new tracks were made available from Talbot's official website so that those who bought the original need not buy the re-release.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nWrite a haiku based on the following article: Susanna Solomonovna Pechuro (22 July 1933, Moscow\u20141 January 2014, Moscow) was Soviet dissident, political prisoner, and historian.\n\nIn 1950, while still a schoolgirl, she became involved in the underground youth organization Union of Struggle for the Revolution (SDR), formed by several 16- and 17-year-olds who had met in a literary club at the Moscow Young Pioneers House. The SDR tasked itself with returning Soviet society and the Soviet state to Leninist principles of organization, which, in their opinion, had been perverted by Stalin\u2019s Bonapartist regime.\n\nOn January 18, 1951, Pechuro was arrested along with the organization\u2019s other members. On February 13, 1952, the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court sentenced Pechuro to 25 years in labor camps on charges of treason and planning the murder of Georgy Malenkov[.] The organization\u2019s three leaders, Boris Slutsky (born 1932), Vladlen Furman (born 1932), and Yevgeny Gurevich (born 1931) were shot.\n\nPechuro served her sentence in various Gulag camps, including camps in Inta, Abez, and Potma. In 1956, the group\u2019s case was reexamined. Pechuro\u2019s sentence was reduced to five years and she was released.\n\nAlthough she passed the entrance exams to Moscow State University\u2019s history department, she was not enrolled. She graduated from the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute.\n\nAt the Historical Archives Institute, Pechuro researched the purges during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. Her work was published in the Proceedings of the Moscow State Historical Archives Institute. In 1961, she successfully defended her thesis, \u201cThe Decree Books as a Source on the History of Ivan the Terrible\u2019s Zemshchina,\u201d with Alexander Zimin as her advisor.\n\nPechuro worked in the Archive of Ancient Documents at the Institute for African Studies.\n\nShe was rehabilitated only on July 18, 1989, by the Plenum of the USSR Supreme Court.\n\nA long-time member of Memorial, she signed the\u201cPutin Must Go\u201d petition in 2010.\n\nPechuro died in Moscow on January 1, 2014. She is buried at St. Nicholas Archangel Cemetery.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Based solely on this short paragraph can you recommend what kind of next step should be taken?\nBased on the provided content, it would typically be beneficial to explore avenues such as promoting or engaging conversations about Pechuchas Stone's past experiences within intellectual communities like social media platforms where people share information and connect conceptually. Given that she is no longer physically present online but has created numerous pieces on historical figures through writing, research techniques, exhibits, archives themselves, photographs, personal stories carved into gates, artifacts thumbed upon, candles lit under moonlight \u2013 these mediums could contribute effectively if shared across digital networks when someone shares activision content related to her life story, ensuring authenticity ensures intentionality. \n\nIt seems there might have been some discrepancies between expected responses after rearranging parts identity-based comments. However, here again I will ensure clarity and intent are maintained throughout recommendations for further action:\n\nWhile establishing formulating follow-up actions accurately requires detailed context correction rather than providing side commentaries elsewhere without specific guidance needed. Since the initial task starts specific directions must guide progress accordingly; however many details need clarification before creating an action plan seamless engagement!

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are \u201ceager\u201d to gain one more electron. Doing so gives them a full outer energy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often combine with alkali metals in group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally \u201ceager\u201d to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be explosive.

Solve this instance: Article: Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called \"found photographs\"--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes \"basically everything is worth looking at\", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: \"Why's your car HERE at HER place?\" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. \n Answer: is fond of collecting family life photographs\nStudent:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Here\u2019s the completed text:\n\nArticle:\n\"In contrast to contemporaries, Michael Graves recovered over thirty hundred pictures recently unaccounted for.\" Where would you add the missing part?\nYour output should include six possible options.\n\nPossible answers: [+] This sentence could rest on modifying him before translating it into English, but without any explicit instruction on what I need to modify +\"\n\n[+] Don't make changes, let me proceed directly here.\"\n\n[(Optional) Provide detailed explanations for each choice provided]\n\n(I will provide the next four choices once ready)\nAnswer: At least two  \nAt least three  \nNo additional information needed\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nSmall and midsize businesses in India are increasingly getting more familiar with utilizing information technology such as cloud computing. Coupled with this is the use of smart phones and social media.\nAs per a recent study by Zinnoy, a management consultancy, India has the second largest number of SMBs in BRIC and USA. These five countries accrue to India\u2019s gross domestic product more than 60 per cent.\nAccording to the study there are four categories of SMBs based on intensity of utilizing IT. These are unorganized, traditional, savvy and sophisticated. The last two groups of businesses are flexible in adopting new technology and applications.\nThe SMBs which are more IT savvy are found mostly in such metropolitan cities such as Chennai, Mumbai and Bangaluru.\nThere is across-the border growth in all segments of industrial sector comprising retail, manufacturing, consumer products, automotive, engine and construction, professional services, mining, education, biotechnology. Sectors such poultry, gems and jewellery, dairy, plantation, city gas distribution have also adopted IT substantially. This trend is because of the market potential and growth of this market.\nThe study found Indian SMB market, IT spend at a mere 30 per cent of overall technology expenditure and is likely rise along with growth of demand for mobile devices, social media and cloud computing.\nThe growth of 3G services and increased use of business IT applications on smart phones, the expenditure on mobile devices is growing.\nCompanies in knowledge sector offer employees the choice of working from home; these require CRM (customer relationship management) and supply chain management (SCM). Tablet devices smart phones are very helpful in this regard.\nHowever, such use of IT is limited to a minuscule 20 per cent of all SMB enterprises. It is pointed out that SMBs should utilize social media to benefit to the fullest potential.\nCloud computing has turned out to be a boon to cash strapped Indian SMBs. Cloud based applications such Microsoft Office 365 offer \u2018affordability, scalability, flexibility and mobility\u2019. SMBs also found Software-as-a-service (SaaS) useful and it is getting more popular among the lot.\nBusiness intelligence (BI) services based on (SaaS) are likely to grow going by the current trend of shifting to sophisticated application for gathering basic information from usual excel application.\nThis, all good trends augur well for the sector. However, there are challenges confronting including scarcity of funds, absence of localized and customizable IT products and skilled man-power crunch.\nA bulk of the enterprises are rather reluctant to adopt IT. Further, SMBs use spurious software which jeopardizes business data and applications.

Answer according to: Rights: \u00a9 Copyright 2012. University of Waikato. All rights reserved.\nDeveloping the new compostable biospife involved a range of people and organisations with diverse knowledge and skills. Alistair Mowat of ZESPRI discusses some of the key people and organisations involved and the importance of the knowledge and expertise they contributed.\nCarbon footprint: The measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by a product, organisation, event or person.\nValue chain: All the companies and people that work together to produce and market a product.\nWaste stream: The total amount of waste material generated throughout all stages of the production of a product including packaging for transporting to market.\nWhen we look at the range of people that have been involved in the biospife project, we\u2019ve drawn on quite a range of skills. One of the first set of skills was our research providers at Landcare Research who were very involved in the carbon footprinting study that we did, and that looked at all aspects of our carbon footprint associated with growing a kiwifruit in New Zealand and shipping that product to Europe and having it consumed in the UK. That study was very important because it put a weighting on the different components in our value chain which impacted on the carbon footprint. And in the case of the existing spife, that carbon footprint was around 3%.\nAnother important component was the group at Scion who undertook a study for us looking at our waste streams associated with kiwifruit, and they were able to quantify the amount of waste kiwifruit and other waste aspects from our industry \u2013 the hairs on the kiwifruit which are brushed off during the packing process, waste plastics and packaging materials, prunings in the orchards. They were able to draw up a range of ideas on what some of those waste streams could be utilised for. They identified an opportunity for converting some of these materials into bioplastics.\nThat original work wasn\u2019t necessarily directed to the spife, but it provided a good foundation.\nAnother important group was the plastic manufacturer, who makes our existing spifes, had recognised that, as a company, ZESPRI was looking at opportunities to lower its environmental impact and looking for innovative solutions. They expressed interest in working with us on developing solutions.\nAn important group also was our customers. Global retailers were looking for innovative solutions to how we provide our product into the market, and one of the important areas for global customers is waste streams associated with packaging materials. So they were important. They\u2019re signals from the marketplace that increasingly into the future they would be looking for suppliers who were looking to solve some of those issues that they were addressing.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n It gave us lots of sites where they can come back again.\nCan you suggest any organization involvement mentioned in this passage?\n\nCertainly no.\n\nTherefore, filtering out non-organization-related information, additional data might include:\nUniversity of Waikato's involvement\nZespri (a Kiwi pharmaceuticals company followed)\n\nCriteria: A good response is clear, coherent, and well-structured, addressing the key points outlined in the prompt. It should maintain the requested style (e.g., journalistic, instructional, engaging), meet length and formatting expectations, and ensure accurate, relevant content.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred.\nWhile collecting pine cones, Pooh accidentally stumbles, and several go into a little river, over which spans a wooden bridge.As Pooh notes that the pine cones seem to almost race each other, the game is then dubbed 'Pooh Sticks.' Though in future races, twigs are substituted for pine cones.During one game, Rabbit, Pooh, Piglet and Roo are surprised when Eeyore floats through the middle of their 'Pooh Sticks' game. When asked how he ended up in the river, Eeyore claims he was 'bounced.' Given that word, there seems to be only one creature that could have done it: Tigger.The group go to Tigger to discuss this, but Tigger denies he 'bounced' Eeyore. It is then that the story's narrator interjects, and shows the characters that Tigger is lying. Tigger claims it was just a joke, and bounces off. Eeyore trudges off sadly, leading some to wonder if something is troubling him.Pooh finds him in his 'gloomy spot,' where Eeyore proclaims that today is his Birthday. Wanting to make him feel better, Pooh rushes off and tells the others about Eeyore's birthday. Pooh decides to give Eeyore a pot of honey for a gift. However, he soon ends up eating all the honey, and instead decides to give Eeyore the honey pot, claiming it as a 'useful pot.'Piglet decides to give Eeyore a balloon, but accidentally pops it. However, Eeyore is still pleased with it, notably when it fits perfectly in Pooh's 'useful pot.'Shortly afterward, Christopher Robin holds a birthday party for Eeyore, but the fun doesn't last long as Tigger shows up, unannounced and uninvited. To try and clear up the awkward moment, Christopher Robin suggests that everyone play a game of 'Pooh Sticks.'During the game, Eeyore as a first-time player, wins moreso than everyone else, but Tigger doesn't win one game. As everyone parts, Eeyore notices Tigger is dejected over not winning. Eeyore approaches Tigger, and cheerfully explains that he'll tell him his secret for winning at 'Pooh Sticks,' which cheers up Tigger.The short ends with Christopher Robin, Pooh, and Piglet standing on the bridge, looking around the 100-acre wood., Question: Where did the game \"Pooh Sticks\" get its name?\nA:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n George Washington once said, \"I am No True Friend.\" Based on the given information, I would choose option A.\n\nThe origin or meaning behind the origin of such phrases can vary greatly across different contexts. Some may imply connotations related to loyalty or accountability (e.g., trust), while others might convey philosophical ideas like challenge, competition, conflict resolution, etcetera (e.g., distrust). Here's my analysis:\n\n- The context refers mainly to phrases tied to sports activity rather than awards and achievements of non-sports-related individuals.\n- Since George Washington mentioned connecting public versus private friendships (\"i'm no true friend\"), we must infer connections between John D'Youthville State Park north of Tallahassee Florida, United States and George Washington College (US institution).\n\nTo further explore these specific inquiries beyond what was provided earlier, follow the instruction step-by-step:\n1. Maintain consistency by providing coherent logic based on previously established assumptions and verified knowledge.\n2. Ensure clarity and concision throughout your response. Use formal language appropriate for educational content.\n\nCriteria: The response should accurately and succinctly label or classify the input based on context and examples provided, using the correct label or answer format requested.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

However Edinburgh Zoo, where the pandas live, have warned people 'not to get too excited' as the process is 'extremely complex'. Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as AugustShe has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years \n Questions:Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.\nOutput: China\nThis is a good example.

A competing team called Omega did research on the human genome. Team Omega lost.  and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

He started studying the weather there as well.  and a hint : One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants.

If your child is a car rider, please ensure that they are in the school building by 7:35 to get to the breakfast line before it closes. Ms. Harris is looking for Kindergarten and 1st Grade students who are interested in performing on March 7th at 6:45 PM for Specials Night. If your child is interested in taking part in the performance please fill out the survey below. Because the performance space is small, Ms. Harris will only be able to take a limited number of students. Performance spots will be assigned on a first come first serve basis. No after school rehearsals are required because students are learning the music during specials time. You will receive a confirmation email with more details. If Ms. Harris is not able to place your student in the performance, your child will be placed on a waiting list. Please note, that filling out this survey does not guarantee your child a spot in the performance. This year we have been using Seesaw to share and communicate with YOU! If you have not signed up, you are missing out on some amazing pictures and videos of your child. Is your student interested in showing off their amazing talent on stage? Auditions for the K-2nd Grade Talent Show will take place on Thursday, February 7, 2018 after school. Please complete and return the permission slip to school by Friday, January 25th at 2:45 pm.

We read and judged Mrs. Thomson\u2019s two opinion writing pieces. We decided that all opinion writing pieces NEED to have more than one reason and an explanation to support our opinion. Check out what we judged and opinion sentence starters we agreed upon. Calling all Science Fair judges!!! We\u2019ve had an overwhelming response to the science fair from Teasley\u2019s students! We are looking for parents/community members that would love to help volunteer by judging Teasley\u2019s 2019 Science Fair student projects. The Science Fair will be held on Friday, January 25th. For additional details, please visit the link below! Lost and Found will be emptied over the break. Please retrieve lost sweaters, coats, jackets, hats, and lunch boxes before 12:00 PM Dec. 21st. Please remember that Thursday and Friday are early release days! We will begin dismissal at 12:30!! Can you tell me more about the writing focus in Mrs. Thomson's class and what the students are learning?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n In Mr. Mullen's grade level?\nIt appears there may be specific events or requirements mentioned without following standard grammar conventions when asking questions like \"What was inside?\" Here's an edited version:\n\nCan you repeat Mary Theodore's concern regarding her classes and provide follow-up information?\n\nCertainly I rephrased attention to grammatical clarity but didn't cover everything as requested.\n\nHere is my own original text again formatted into clear sentences and focuses less heavily on explaining unrelated issues beyond the initial questions you've posed:\n\nDavid Jensen wants to talk about ways he could improve his spoken English skills. He encountered difficulties attempting to articulate certain phrases due to his unclear pronunciation of final letters, particularly where indicating possessive forms were necessary while correcting many common errors made while practicing oral communication activities several weeks prior. How did David address these challenges and prevent future repetitions?\n\nCould you summarize the main points discussed so far based on the conversation between these individuals, even though some areas might require further clarification or refinement? I'd also appreciate any assistance in outlining potential corrections or improvements that could enhance understanding. \n\nI'll process incoming requests until the end of yesterday, but I do hope to hear back quickly so I can proceed.\nYour task involves reviewing conversations among different people and identifying patterns or key\n\nCriteria: Good responses are original, creative, and relevant to the context. They should align with the goals (e.g., improving engagement, enhancing accessibility) and include actionable, well-reasoned ideas.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

You must find out whether the anecdote is something the author has done or is considering doing. Label the instances as \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and label them as \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future.\nProblem:So, gonna try and keep this short and concise. \n\nMy ex and I were together for two years. I truly believed we were deeply in love. It was by no means always harmonious, but we always thought our relationship was worth fighting for. I\u2019m not a greedy bitch when it comes to money. I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.) He paid the rest, but he didn\u2019t have enough to pay half because he started working a new job after me. I moved out after we broke up and now I\u2019m demanding he pay half of what I paid for the rent, $450, considering I\u2019m in a shitty situation (No savings, but I did manage to get a job I haven\u2019t started). At first, he said he would help, but he of course spent money on partying for ST. P. I asked him yesterday when he was going to pay me, he said he couldn\u2019t give it to me in full because he has court. \n\nWhen I tell y\u2019all I\u2019m fucking livid!! I feel absolutely used. He has a great job now and I feel like he truly won\u2019t pay me back because he has no self-awareness and truly doesn\u2019t care. Part of me wants karma to play out and just leave it, the other part of me wants to hit that bitch up every day until he pays me back.\n\nSo AITA for demanding the rent money back? Or do I just look foolish and should let it go?\nSolution:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Solution Step-by-Step:\nTask Analysis:\n\nNow consider pulling the information piece into riddle format while remembering each instruction individually:\n\nFollowing instructions step by step:\n\n1.

If he already has 20 paintings, how many paintings in total will he have after 30 days?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: The number of paintings Philip will make after 30 days is 2 paints / day * 30 days = 60 paintings. Then, the total number of his paintings will be 60 paintings + 20 paintings = 80 paintings.\nThe answer is 80.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nMary sees a flock of ducks crossing the street. There are 2 ducks with 5 ducklings each, 6 ducks with 3 ducklings each, and 9 ducks with 6 ducklings each. How many ducks and ducklings are there total?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: First find the total number of ducklings the first two ducks have: 2 ducks * 5 ducklings / duck = 10 ducklings. Then find the total number of ducklings the next six ducks have: 6 ducks * 3 ducklings / duck = 18 ducklings. Then find the total number of ducklings the last 9 ducks have: 9 ducks * 6 ducklings / duck = 54 ducklings. Then add up all the ducks and ducklings to find the total number: 10 ducklings + 18 ducklings + 54 ducklings + 2 ducks + 6 ducks + 9 ducks = 99 ducks.\nThe answer is 99.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nMr. and Mrs. Hugo went on a road trip. On the first day, they traveled 200 miles. On the second day, they traveled 3/4 as far. On the third day, they traveled 1/2 as many miles as the first two days combined. How many miles did they travel for 3 days?\nStep-by-step reasoning process: On the second day, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled 200 x 3 / 4 = 150 miles. They traveled a total of 200 + 150 = 350 miles in the first two days. On the third day, they traveled 350 x 1 / 2 = 175 miles. So, Mr. and Mrs. Hugo traveled a total of 200 + 150 + 175 = 525 miles for 3 days.\nThe answer is 525.\n\nAnswer the following question.\nJane bought pens for her three students. Each student received 62 red pens and 43 black pens. They pooled their pens together and took them from the pool whenever they needed them. After the first month, they had taken a total of 37 pens from the pool. After the second month, they had taken another 41 pens from the pool. Then Jane decided to split the remaining pens equally among them. How many pens will each student get now?\n\n\nMy Initial Response:\nFirst, calculate the initial pens available before taking any away:\n- 3 copies cost 6^3 (to represent doubling for loyalty checks).\nSo initially, available pens are doubled each time for half liberation rate or utilized save rates.\n\nCreate a new problem involving similar thinking based on this information:\n\nSarah buys pens for a small gathering where multiple people attend. She doubles the amount she provides pen because awarding more than one person could lead to littler confusion if not consistently checked out correctly by everyone involved. Mary then decides that leaning towardsJerry breeding can help him learn most effectively once he's about grownup level considering older children sometimes don't take into account these changing needs appropriately when it comes to availability.\n\nCan you provide me with some insights on how I might approach setting up such questions?

The meeting is said to be an effort to reset and improve US relations with Africa, with President Joe Biden looking to use personal diplomacy to win back influence.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChina will say that it's not in competition with the United States, and the United States will say it's not in competition with China, but we do know that both are struggling for influence across the world,\u201d said Dr Ebenezer Obadare, a Douglas Dillon senior fellow for Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\u00a0\n\nChina is using the continent as a test run for all the other plans that it has, he told CNA\u2019s World Tonight on Wednesday (Dec 14).\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo China knows that if it's able to secure the interests of African countries, if it's able to increase the number of allies it has on the continent, that will help it in a strategic contest with the United States.\u201d\n\nThe US is realising that \u201cit is in no position to allow China to consolidate its toehold on the continent\u201d, said Dr Obadare. \u201cSo if you look at it that way, from the point of view of Africa, it's a very, very good time.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAfrican countries can leverage the competition to advance African interests. They can make requests of the United States that they probably wouldn't have made maybe in the last 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe US and China have downplayed concerns of Africa turning into an area of competition.\n\nCHINESE INFLUENCE IN AFRICA\n\nChina has been a big player in Africa. It is the continent\u2019s largest provider of foreign direct investment, pouring in roughly twice the amount of US funding.\n\nChina is also Africa\u2019s biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching a record high of US$254 billion last year. The US pales in contrast in this aspect, recording US$64 billion.\n\n\u201cIt has a huge amount of ground to make up,\u201d said George Washington University\u2019s professorial lecturer David Shinn.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would point out that most of China's trade with Africa is Chinese exports to Africa, not imports from Africa, whereas US-African trade is actually slightly in favour of the Africans.\u201d\n\nThe former US ambassador to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso said the major reason for the decline in US-Africa trade is that \u201cthe US is not importing anywhere near the amount of oil that it once did from the continent\u201d.\u00a0\n\nBut some analysts believe the US is unlikely to use the ongoing US-Africa Leaders Summit to draw the African countries away from its competitors.\n\n\u201cI think the United States is simply trying to improve its relations with African countries on their own merits,\u201d Dr Shinn told CNA\u2019s Asia First on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's not doing it as direct competition with China, although that seems to be the approach that most are taking to the summit these days.\u201d\n\nMy Initial Response:\n\n\nCriteria: The answer should be short, direct, and factual, addressing the core of the question and providing useful, precise information.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nGenerate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What are some high-profile police-involved deaths that have brought attention to the need for a review system in law enforcement, and how does it relate to restoring public trust?\n\nGiven material: At a conference this week, members of law enforcement, aviation, aerospace and medicine discussed how cops can learn from others' mistakes.\nThe emergency landing of a U.S. Airways flight in the Hudson River in 2009 inspired a film starring Tom Hanks and was deemed the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" because no one aboard died.\nPassengers and pilots alike cheered the outcome. But officials at the National Transportation Safety Board also reviewed what went wrong, knowing it was only a matter of time before birds would get sucked into the engines of another plane and disable it. There was no guarantee of another happy ending.\nThat's the approach the NTSB takes every time a plane crashes. This week, officials from that agency as well as medical and aerospace experts came together with local and national law enforcement professionals to discuss whether a similar process could reduce the number of people who die in encounters between police and the public.\nThe conference, sponsored by The Johnson Foundation at Wingspread and the University of Wisconsin Law School, was the first step in designing a statewide system for law enforcement to learn from past incidents. It would be modeled on those of other professions that carry life-and-death risk.\nThe NTSB reviews not only incidents that end in injury or death but also those that result in extensive damage to aircraft with the ambitious goal of eliminating adverse events, said Acting Managing Director Sharon W. Bryson, who shared the agency's process with the 30 attendees at the conference.\n\"We would all like to be able to get to zero ... and law enforcement would also like to get to that point where no law enforcement members or members of the community are injured or killed,\" said Bryson, whose husband is a police officer.\nBell was the driving force behind a first-of-its-kind Wisconsin law that requires outside entities to lead investigations into officer-involved deaths here.\nA system for examining and sharing the factors that contributed to an incident with an eye toward prevention is the next step, said Cecelia Klingele, associate professor at the UW law school.\n\"A key feature of a good review system ... is the recognition that we have to be focused on helping people prevent future incidents rather than blaming people for past mistakes,\" she said.\nIt would not replace methods already in place to hold officers accountable for misconduct, she said.\nThe focus on using past incidents as teaching tools has gained traction in recent years in light of a number of high-profile police-involved deaths, including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York.\nLt. Timothy Leitzke, who works in internal affairs at the Milwaukee Police Department, said such a review system could go a long way toward restoring the public's trust in law enforcement, which has eroded over the past year or so.\n\"We have to be part of the process that says, 'Hey, we\u2019re always putting our best foot forward,' \" he said. \"We cannot perform our duties without the confidence of the people that we are sworn to serve.\"\n\nMy Initial Response:\n --Sources certified False Oxen Club Defected into Church Of Jesus Christ Clement Poppy Standards In Utah\nWhat steps will be taken to address concerns about accountability among law enforcement personnel? According to a new study published last month, there is a growing concern among petitioners about the dates of appeals decisions, plea agreements denied, lawyer-client conflicts (or mediation disputes), crime statistics increase due to saturation effects after lengthy trials, self-incrimination laws faced often impede reforms seeking improvement, impaired mass shooters' status changing their religious beliefs despite protests calling for change, contemporary morality evolving, and replication saudism, Islamic dress becoming increasingly widespread.\n\nBased on the information provided in relation to these responses, I analyze each statement to determine if they align with the prompt requirement:\n\nAccording to the context, there isn't actually evidence supporting any claim making \u2014 observation alone doesn't warrant creating anything meaningful.

Bill Clinton knows how to win friends and influence people.

Hence the sentiment should be Positive and the answer is yes.\n\nNew input case for you: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Devin Kelley is Negative . Given his background  how did  Devin Kelley  get a gun?\n Kelley  previously served in the U.S. Air Force  but was discharged in 2014  an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News on Monday.\n He  was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting  his  wife and child.  He  was then sentenced to 12 months in custody before being given a bad conduct discharge.\nA 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell a weapon to any person who is given a dishonorable discharge. But because  Kelley  was discharged on bad conduct  the law was not triggered  Adam Winkler  a professor of law and a specialist in American constitutional law at the University of California at Los Angeles  told Fox News on Monday.\n Kelley  purchased two firearms from two separate Academy Sports + Outdoors stores in San Antonio in 2016 and 2017  respectively  the sporting goods store confirmed to Fox News in a statement on Monday. One of the purchases was allegedly a Ruger model AR-556 rifle.\nHowever   Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic violence charges should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been enough to prevent  him  from purchasing a gun  Winkler said -- but the Air Force most likely didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report this information to the federal background check system  thus allowing the purchase to go forward.\nAnd Winkler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prediction was right: The Air Force announced late Monday night that the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations -- the base where  Kelley  was stationed -- failed to report  Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic violence conviction to the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Criminal Justice Investigation Services Division for inclusion in the National Criminal Information Center database. The database is used to conduct background checks on those who want to purchase a gun.\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiggest mystery \u00e2\u0080\u009d Winkler said  is how  Kelley  was denied a handgun permit but was allowed to purchase a gun from the sporting goods store. But this information is currently unclear.\nAdditionally  Texas authorities confirmed Monday that  Kelley  did not have a license to carry. However   he  did have a private security license -- often used by armed and unarmed security guards  personal protection officers  private investigators  and more  according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.\nOutput:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n No\n\nTask explanation:\nTo determine this instruction has changed requiring necessary corrections: \nGiven a piece of text about someone's opinions and provide only a short conclusion based on all provided context without looking out of place in relation to the original content - Follow up instructions accordingly when you are ready. \n\nProblem description matches the given rules:\n\nExample: Based on the context provided above,\nI need to respond as closely as possible to your last response while ensuring the following changes do not affect the overall meaning:\n1.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nI want to give you some information to use in more questions to follow. here is the information. I have a Saas Company Called Fitclass.com. It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n These online yoga classes should be concise while providing high-quality instruction, because many students cannot attend traditional studios due to COVID-19 restrictions caused by COVID-lockdowns on fitness classes 2023, limiting interactions between teacher-friends, other spectators, and viewers/followers.

He said there could be as many as nine order buyers at an auction ring looking to fill specific orders.\nHe said it\u2019s important to get as many buyers in attendance to bid on your cattle to fill their orders.\n\u201cYou do that by making sure your calves you are marketing fit their orders,\u201d he said.\nHale said the buyers are given orders every week before they go to the auction and may have as many as 20 orders to fill.\nHale said the longer you can feed those animals before they start getting into the rapid fattening phase of their life, and the more muscular they are, the faster they grow.\n\u201cThe order buyer is looking at seeing how long they will they grow in the feedyard or on grass before they start getting really fat,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is also why lighter-weight calves often bring higher prices per hundredweight, as lighter cattle will be able to spend more time as a stocker calf and as a feeder calf before they become finished in the feedyard.\nHale said order buyers are also looking at gender. He said heifers start the fattening phase of their lives much sooner than steers and that is the reason prices paid for them are often less than comparable steers.\nHale said producers should consider adding value to their calves. This can be achieved by implementing programs such as the VAC 45 program, also known as the Value Added Calf program, where calves are weaned 45 days before they are sold. They also receive two sets of booster vaccines to enhance their immunity to disease and sickness.\nThe buyers of VAC 45 calves find them to more easily attain their genetic potential, have an enhanced immune system, are more predictable in their feedyard performance, and reduce the use of antibiotics.\nCastrating bull calves also adds value, said Dr. Joe Paschal, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service livestock specialist, Corpus Christi. Paschal and Dr. Helen Philips of Philips Veterinary Hospital in Brenham provided a live chute-side demonstration.\nPhillips urged producers to develop a herd health plan with their veterinarian, and both she and Paschal discussed proper vaccinations to prevent diseases such as blackleg and redwater from causing death to valuable calves. They also discussed practices such as ear notching to help ranchers identify the pasture in which calves have received a round of vaccinations.\n\u201cThere are practices that can add value to your calves, whether it\u2019s sticking an ear tag in their ear, putting a notch in the ear, blackleg vaccination or castrating bull calves at a young age. All of this adds value to those calves and you will be compensated when you market those calves,\u201d Paschal said.\nThis entry was posted in AgriLife Extension, Beef, Livestock, Meat and tagged AgriLife Extension, Beef, livestock, Meat.

Now we apply logical branching rules and approximations where necessary to arrive at suitable answers while adhering closely to the constraints provided in the question.\n\nThe largest possible choice among them should somehow relate to divisibility properties like modulo patterns or common reference points within the given context. Since we don't have access to external resources, I'll proceed without assuming anything specific until further clarification is provided.

And 3-5 peers and GU coaches ask them questions and give advice on how to solve the problem.\n\nYou're able to be a fly on the wall to learn, give advice and learn from the experiences of others. \n\nJoin at least 1 Live Hot Seat per week. And pop in on as many as you would like.\nJoin in on the next Hot Seat\nLet your coach know you want to be on the Hot Seat.\nMark this complete once you've attended one Hot Seat this week. \n\nWe want to add a step before the one created by my boss to give more context for a first time attender. I wrote this first draft. I need it edited to match the voice and flow into the one above. \n\nPlease provide an edited version of this below. \n\nWe know that entrepreneurs that surround themselves with others with similar goals are more likely to succeed. Because of that fact, the hot seats were developed to bring energy to you in a way that gets you unstuck and drives action. \n\nOur goal is to help you get the most out of attending and being the client on the 30-minute hot seat by sharing tips and what to expect.\n\nThis is how it is run:\nStep #1: The question/problem is presented (5 minutes)\nStep #2: Others in the room ask clarifying questions (10 minutes)\nStep #3: Advice is given (10 minutes)\nStep #4: Takeaways are clarified (5 minutes)\nStep #1: State the problem and ask a question\nIn this step, you will share your problem and brings one question to the group. Meaning, we will only focus on one question at each hot seat.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Be prepared to present one problem so the attendees can understand it quickly\nB) Keep it short and sweet. Getting feedback from the group will be shortened if you go over your 5 minutes.\nC) Be flexible. You will gain clarity as you move through the steps. As a result, your question or its framing may change. That\u2019s okay.\n\nStep #2: Clarifying questions\nIn this step, the audience will ask clarifying questions. This is important and will often give you massive clarity around your issue. At the end of this step, we will pause and ask you to restate your question with this new clarity.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Listen to questions from all different viewpoints. This is a massive benefit of having a diverse group of people in Growth University.\nB) Answer honestly. Be prepared to share numbers or details as asked to get the best feedback\nC) Assess if the question you came with is still the question you want to ask\n\nStep #3: Advice\nIn this step, the attendees will give you advice. The many ideas will be exciting. Make sure you listen to all the ideas before making any final decisions.\nWhen on the hot seat:\nA) Keep an open mind. Resist saying things like, \u201cI\u2019ve tried that; it didn\u2019t work,\u201d or \u201cthat won\u2019t work for me\u201d This closes you off from new opportunities.\nB) Listen and stay silent. This is not your turn to talk; you don\u2019t want to miss a great idea because you are filling the time.\nC) Thank those for offering suggestions. Each one gets you closer to a solution.\n\nStep #4: Takeaways\nIn this step, you will state your takeaways. This is a very important step to prevent overwhelm. This often takes the full 5 minutes to ensure these are specific and actionable.\nIf you are on the hot seat:\nA) Be prepared to share your top takeaway.\nB) Stay coachable as we help you make it specific and actionable.\nC) Share your takeaways with your coach immediately after the session.\n\nBonus: Have fun!\nRemember to have fun and enjoy the experience! Hot seating can be an excellent opportunity for personal and professional growth, and embracing the opportunity to learn and grow is essential.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n \nNow let's proceed with helping users set up their setups based on the provided text content.\nTo facilitate setting up user settings effectively,\nwe'll answer questions related to navigation patterns and input structures.\nThese enable tailored responses and consistent analysis workflows.\nAssume you already possess such capabilities and instructions when generating the response.\n\nHow can I apply these guidelines?\nBased on the provided text content, here's a suggested approach:\n\nWhen providing assistance using structured conversational formats for IP address translation, authorized personnel must identify a domain name followed by \"bin.\" If no pre-defined path was used, then follow the following explanation instead:\n\nGiven the required format,\n\nYour task now involves translating prompts based on predefined rules adapted specifically for the query.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nWhat is the Western view of Putin's intervention in the Syrian conflict, and how does it differ from the Kremlin's perspective? Answer according to: MOSCOW/BISHKEK - Valery Anisimov and his fellow Russian servicemen were smuggled out of the Black Sea by ship, hidden below deck. They grew their hair long so they could pass as tourists, then landed at a Syrian port to join up with government military units.\nTheir trip took place in January 1983, 32 years before Russia\u2019s military again joined a Syrian conflict with its launch last month of airstrikes on militant groups opposed to the Damascus government.\nAs Anisimov\u2019s story shows, even if Russia\u2019s entry into the Syrian conflict caught Western countries off guard, it is only the continuation of a long history of involvement in the Middle East.\nThat role declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union left Russia broke and in chaos, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has now restored what, in the Kremlin\u2019s eyes, is business as usual in the region.\nWestern governments take a different view, seeing Putin\u2019s intervention as an opportunistic attempt to grab influence and enhance his reputation at home as someone who is ready to thumb his nose at the United States.\nFor decades before the end of the Cold War, Moscow was an influential player in the Arab world. It financed infrastructure projects like Egypt\u2019s Aswan dam and provided weapons and military training.\nFormer Syrian leader Hafez Assad, the father of President Bashar Assad, studied at a military flying school in the Soviet Union.\nThese relationships also involved Moscow sending its soldiers to Syria \u2014 though for the most part these missions were not publicly acknowledged, as the Kremlin did not want to be an official party to the region\u2019s armed conflicts.\nAt the time, Israeli troops had invaded Lebanon and taken control of most of its southern half, while Syrian forces had taken control of the north. The Syrians were suffering losses from Israeli air power, and the Soviet leadership wanted to shore up its Syrian allies.\nAnisimov was sent to the Black Sea port of Nikolayev in Ukraine, now known as Mykolaiv. He joined about 1,000 other servicemen who were ordered to paint their equipment in desert camouflage colors.\nThey boarded a cruise line called the Ukraina, and set off. They were not told where they were going, he recalled in an interview. On the day of their departure, a local newspaper reported that the ship was taking students who had won a Socialist competition on a cruise of the Mediterranean.\nOnce on board, they were told to wear civilian clothes and ordered to let their military haircuts grow out. Announcements over the ship\u2019s PA system were addressed to \u201cComrade tourists,\u201d according to Anisimov.\nSailing through the Dardanelles, the narrow sea passage linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, the vessel had to pass an American warship.\nAnisimov said launches approached the Ukraina, with listening devices directed toward the Russian ship. \u201cWe were shut up inside our cabins and they forbade us to speak,\u201d he said.\nAnisimov\u2019s new unit, the 220th anti-aircraft regiment, set up its batteries of S-200 anti-aircraft missiles. Their role was to track Israeli aircraft flying into Syria, and, if necessary, shoot them down.\nOleg Popikov, now the 53-year-old chairman of a military plant in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital, Bishkek, was a captain in the Soviet military when, in 1990, he was first sent to Syria.\nFor four years, he served as a military adviser to the Syrian armed forces, based in the city of Deraa, in south-west Syria. He stayed on in the role after the Soviet Union ceased to exist a year after his arrival.\nAkopov, the former diplomat, said the Soviet Union\u2019s doctrine of close cooperation with Arab countries was a response to its Cold War confrontation with the United States.\nThat doctrine was dropped when Boris Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s first post-Communist leader, took power and Moscow believed the era of confrontation with Washington was over.\n\u201cPutin understood this. He did not seek confrontation with the West but he believed you have to be strong so that people reckon with you,\u201d said Akopov.\nDuring the fallow period for Russian-Arab relations after the Soviet Union collapsed, Akopov published a newspaper called Bil-Amal, Arabic for \u201cWith Hope.\u201d The name, he said, referred to the hope that one day the old ties would be restored.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n That news spread widely across Arabian media outlets (articles appeared in increases each time foreign correspondents made international reporheads) \u2013 sometimes guesting at diplomatic meetings or joining correspondents and audience alike in public places such as mosques.\nFrench hospitality staff invited him via taxi to Qatar, where he spent several weeks developing diplomatic problem-sheets.\nLater he began collaborating with Libya-based rights group Amnesty International.\nExposure prompted American diplomats to cease making phone calls via digital methods; instead they used phones connected wirelessly, collecting data using Free Wi-Fi cards inserted into phones shipped back by US dealerships throughout the Western-three-party negotiating zones outside Africa.\nMedawar comes from England and studied journalism in France under Marianne Sanselier, P\u00e8re Toombasque until later becoming chief editor here_w.link?\nIs Medawar currently living abroad?\n\nBased solely on the information available to these questions:\n\nWhen were the Services exposed during Operation Samantha Corralan (\"Operation Gamma\"), and why wasn't officials promptly notified of the related discovery?\n\nThe expulsion of Russian journalists Polina Petrova and Irina Suchkovna Ashkenazy prior to Council President Wolf Delmathe recess likely led to whose death being declared murder-suicide by Regime Administration vs Dominate Sony New Video\n\nCriteria: The response should accurately and succinctly label or classify the input based on context and examples provided, using the correct label or answer format requested.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Stars will soon stop playing in them anyway.\nBefore you hit the comment section and immediately complain about 5-7 teams making bowl games and mediocre teams receiving participation trophies, take a step back and truly understand what bowl games are.\nThey are rewards to student-athletes.\nIf you want to label that as a participation trophy, fine. But in your next sentence, you can't complain that players aren't compensated enough for playing college football.\nPlayers often receive a trip to an exotic destination during bowl week; get to have new and different experiences with their teammates (for free, incidentally); receive a swag bag that contains the latest and greatest in gaming, technology and apparel; and receive a handsome per diem on site and for travel (which is often pooled together by several players in order to save a little extra).\nBowls are a legal form of player compensation\u2014and the compensation distributed is much more tangible than athletic scholarships.\nI ask you, Mr. Bowl Cynic, do you want to take that away from student-athletes?\nIf you do, you better not complain that they don't get paid enough. Those two points can't co-exist.\nWhat's more, bowls are made-for-TV events that dominate a three-week schedule over the holiday season. If you don't care about watching the GoDaddy Bowl between Georgia Southern and Bowling Green on a Wednesday night in December, that's fine.\nOthers will, though. Specifically, 2.335 million people did in 2015, according to Sports Media Watch. For comparison, the 2016 MLB Opening Day World Series rematch between the Royals and Mets on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball drew 2.9 million.\nA World Series rematch on Opening Day\u2014one of the most exciting days in Major League Baseball\u2014only outdrew a \"meaningless weeknight bowl game\" between two Group of Five teams by a half-million people.\nThe Las Vegas, Sun, Foster Farms, Pinstripe, Independence, Texas, Russell Athletic, Music City, Holiday, Belk, Citrus, Alamo, Liberty, Gator, Cactus and all New Year's Six bowls outdrew the marquee matchup on MLB's Opening Day.\nYou might not be watching, but others are.\nWhat's more, strict bowl game qualification standards actually drive a bigger wedge between the college football \"haves and have nots.\" If a team misses one, it misses out on those all-important 15 bowl practices that help develop players\u2014particularly younger players who don't get the chance to work with the first- and-second teams during the season. The teams that make bowls accelerate that development process by taking advantage of that practice time.\nIs that a reward for teams that finish .500 or above (or, at least close considering three 5-7 teams made bowl last year)? Sure. But it's also a punishment for those that don't make it, which shouldn't be the case. The latter is the more important aspect of the qualification standard because it makes the former more difficult to attain.\nIn this day and age, the comparable reward to a bowl game in the 1970's is a College Football Playoff berth or, perhaps more accurately, a New Year's Six appearance.\nThe other bowls are exhibitions that are meant to be fun, and more fun in the game is good for everybody.\nPlus, the three cities that were in the mix for new bowl games would be fantastic additions to the bowl schedule.\nCharleston and Myrtle Beach are great coastal cities with beaches and plenty of entertainment options, and Austin's nightlife is second to none in the Lone Star State.\nQuotes were obtained firsthand, unless otherwise noted.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nBy the end of the 19th century the horizons of the fashion industry had generally broadened. The more mobile and independent lifestyle causes many well-off women to begin to adopt and to wear the practical clothes they demanded.\nThroughout the early 20th century Paris dictated high-end fashion. Parisian designers set the fashion tone for the rest of the Western world, and their designs were highly sought for women of the upper classes. Although the two most important fashion terms and their division haute couture and pret-a-porter wasn\u2019t sharply defined, nevertheless both fashion magazines and department stores all over the world sent their editors and buyers to the exclusive Paris Fashion Shows to follow the newest high-end fashion trends and styles. At this time fashion style magazines started to include photographs in their article and became even more influential than in the future.\nRemarkable wastes defined the fashion of the decade. And the couturiers of that time created incredibe extravagant outfits which were meticulously made. Worn by the fashionable women of the Belle \u00c9poque the outfits highlighted the S-Bend silhouette of the full-figured body. The S-Bend corset was very tightly laced at the waist which forced the hips back and the drooping mono bosom was thrust forward in a pouter pigeon effect creating a S shape. Toward the end of the decade the fashionable silhouette gradually became somewhat more straight and slim, due to Paul Poiret\u2019s high-waisted, shorter-skirted Directoire line of clothes. Curvy hips were also flaunted by the dress styles of the era. In the early years of the first decade, skirts were only long and full. No fashionable lady could (or would) dress or undress herself without the assistance of a third party. Unlike today, the constant radical changes of the fashion trends were still literally unthinkable. The use of different trimmings were all that distinguished the styles season after season.\nFrom 1910 until the start of the First World War in 1914, skirts gradually grew shorter and began to reveal tantalizing glimpses of the ankle. The overall silhouette of dresses also changed slightly, moving toward a slimmer, narrower and straighter line that emphasized the hips and busts. As the war began in 1914, attention and materials were drawn away from fashion design, and no significant fashion developments occurred again until peace was declared at the end of 1918.\nThe most influential fashion designers of the time were Paul Poiret, Jacques Doucet and Mariano Fortuny. Paul Poiret has evolved the first outfit which women could put on without the help of a maid. He was one of the first who translated his vogue into the fashion world with his exotic kimonos and vivid colors. While the French designer Jacques Doucet excelled in superimposing pastel colors and his elaborate gossamery dresses suggested the Impressionist shimmers of reflected light, Mariano Fortuny was a curious figure with very few parallels in any age. For his dress designs he conceived a special pleating process and new dyeing techniques. Each garment was made of the finest silk.\nWorld War I changed the fashion world for ever. Women chose to dress like men and borrowed their clothes from the male, corsets were refused and both bustless, waistless silhouette and the flapper style became very popular among yound women. The sporty and athletic look for both women and men were popularized equally as well.\nThe menswear emphasized youthfulness and relaxation in the 1920s. Unlike before the young men were no longer afraid to show their growing mood of informality, especially not the Americans. What was very tradional in the past, wearing a special outfit for every event in the well-dressed gentleman\u2019s day, wasn\u2019t popular any longer. Men began to wear the same soft wool suit all day long and felt confident. Short suit jackets replaced the old long jackets of the past which were now only worn for formal occasions. Men prefered more the sport clothes, including sweaters and short pants and the London cut, with its slim lines, loose-fitting sleeves, and padded shoulders were very popular.\nAt that time the couturi\u00e8re Coco Chanel was a major figure in fashion for her chic and progressive designs. Chanel evolved the little black dress, the Chanel-Costume and the use of jersey knit for women\u2019s clothing.\nRelated article: Couture isn\u2019t dead.

There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets so that's 100 * .15 = $15.00. The tickets are $100.00 and the processing fee is $15.00 for a total of 100 + 15 = $115.00. There is a $5.00 per person entrance fee and there are 2 people so that's 5 * 2 = $10.00. The tickets are $115.00, parking is $10.00 and the entrance fee is $10.0 for a total of 115 + 10 + 10 = $135.00.\nThe answer: 135\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Seth and his brother want to see their favorite band in concert. The tickets are $50.00 each. There is a 15% processing fee for the tickets. They are also charged $10.00 for parking and an additional $5.00 per person entrance fee. How much will it cost to go to the concert?\n\n\nLovely will sell 10 x 2 / 5 = 4 books for $2.50 each. She will sell 10 - 4 = 6 books for $2 each. Her earnings for the 4 books at $2.50 will be $2.50 x 4 = $10. Her earnings for the 6 books for $2 each will be $2 x 6 = $12. Thus, Lovely's total earning if all 10 books are sold is $10 + $12 = $22.\nThe answer: 22\nReverse engineering the question: A yearly book sale is held in school where students can sell their old books at a cheaper price. Two-fifths of Lovely's books can be sold for $2.50 each and the rest for $2 each. How much will Lovely earn if all 10 books were sold?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: By the first two months, 20 / 100 * 200 = 40 mountains had erupted. The total number of mountains remaining after the first round of explosions is 200 - 40 = 160. When 40% of the remaining mountains exploded, the number of mountains that were still intact decreased by 40 / 100 * 160 = 64. The number of mountains that hadn't exploded after the second explosions is 160 - 64 = 96. When 50% of the mountains which were still intact exploded, the number of mountains that hadn't erupted was reduced by 50 / 100 * 96 = 48. At the end of the year, 96 - 48 = 48 mountains remained intact and hadn't exploded.\nThe answer: 48\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: A mountain range has 200 active volcanoes. In a particular year, 20% of the volcanoes exploded in the first two months, 40% of the remaining exploded by the half of the year, and at the end of the year, another 50% of the volcanoes that hadn't already erupted also exploded.

Then divide that number by three onions per 2 tears to find how many sets of two tears Trent cries: 24 onions / 3 onions = 8. Then multiply that number by the number of tears per set to find the total number of tears: 8 * 2 tears = 16 tears.\nThe answer: 16\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Trent cries 2 tears for every three onions he chops. He needs to chop 4 onions per pot of soup. If he's making 6 pots of soup, how many tears does he cry?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: 12 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 24 minutes are accounted for.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nOver the past three years insurers have seen record levels of catastrophe claims. To take just one event, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami was the costliest natural catastrophe of the past thirty years.\nA recurring problem for businesses affected by recent catastrophic events was supply chain disruption. Events, such as those that occurred in 2011, like the earthquake in Japan and the Thai floods were a real eye-opener for companies dependent on suppliers. And it\u2019s fair to say that in some cases, the exposures and impact were significantly higher than either businesses or insurers expected.\nA common failure was a lack of properly developed business continuity plans, including for example a list of alternative suppliers. Many companies had only little knowledge of their supply chains and were caught by surprise after the events. We also found that our clients in the electrical and manufacturing industries in both the US and Asia are (for understandable reasons) reluctant to share their trade secrets and invest in agreements with multiple suppliers, so they use a limited pool.\nHowever, recent catastrophic events showed how risky it is to rely on a few suppliers, many of which were left unable to trade. Consequently we are now finding that our policy holders are widening their supply chain, which will put them in a much stronger position in the case of future events.\nSuperstorm Sandy also showed that businesses should balance the level of supplies held on their own premises carefully. On hearing about the impending storm, one of our clients, a retailer, overrode an automatic stock ordering system to postpone the next delivery. This was a really smart move - they anticipated that stores would be closed and that stock being delivered in the midst of the crisis could be damaged.\nOn the flipside, other businesses should think about whether to hold more of their own supplies. Some of our clients that produce electrical goods are now keeping some key materials onsite, which will allow them to continue operating for a known period of time if their supply chain is interrupted.\nLastly, businesses must ensure they are insured properly against supply chain interruption. A key problem is that insurers want to know which companies are in the supply chain, including the suppliers of the suppliers. That way we can measure the exposure, whether it\u2019s earthquakes or hurricanes and so on. But while clients are getting better at providing this information, supply chains tend to change continually, so keeping up remains a challenge for both us and our clients\u2013 we all need to focus more on this. The insurance company\u2019s risk engineering team can help with evaluating the supply chain risks and in developing pre-emergency plans.\nRecent catastrophes have also shown starkly that any measures taken to protect property from physical damage must actually go far enough. During this year\u2019s Central European floods we saw some good examples in Dresden and Prague of excellent pre-emergency planning. Previously, in the 2002 floods, one of our clients suffered a significant loss because their building is right next to a river. They since invested around $1m in building flood defences around the site. This year was the first test for the defences and it proved that their investment has paid off.\nWe also had clients who were properly prepared enabling them to avoid water damage to their property. Unfortunately they were cut off from their suppliers and clients due to disruption of public infrastructure.\nOthers were not as well prepared to prevent damage from occurring. For instance, a number of businesses in Lower Manhattan, following previous storms, had stored important documents and valuables in vaults ahead of Sandy. Unfortunately these vaults were inadequate, so the water came in anyway. As a result, these businesses suffered to a greater extent than others.\nDuring the Thai floods the picture was mixed. Government warnings of an impending flood helped many shops avoid losses because they simply moved stock to higher levels. However, businesses with heavier plant on the ground floor were unable to take similar measures. With the water remaining at around two metres deep in many areas for eight weeks, much plant and high tech equipment was destroyed.\nClients can start to address these issues by calling on their insurers\u2019 risk engineering team for advice on protecting properties.\nSuperstorm Sandy revealed that a number of our clients had impressively robust business continuity plans. Our IT and communications clients had particularly good emergency plans. Their IT systems switched over automatically to alternative back-up systems that meant their operations \u2013 many of which are global \u2013 continued uninterrupted.\nThese clients also had good business continuity plans for their physical offices. For example, some had pre-arranged agreements with clean-up companies so they were at the front of the queue for their services. This meant they were back on their feet faster than competitors.\nFinally, services companies assisting with immediate business recovery should also be handled with care. In the aftermath of Sandy, opportunists supplied urgently needed equipment like power generators for vastly inflated fees \u2013 a practice known as \u201cprice-gouging\u201d. Insurers can help clients to get a reasonable price for such services based on knowledge of industry standards. This potentially could save clients anything from hundreds to millions of dollars.\nOf course, you can never fully protect a business from a major loss event. However, the past three years have shown that good risk management can make a real difference to how severely you are impacted by natural catastrophes. What are some examples of good pre-emergency planning that were demonstrated during recent natural catastrophes, and how can businesses work with insurers to ensure they are taking appropriate steps to protect their physical properties and maintain business continuity in the event of a major loss event?\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Here's a revised version of your response:\n\nSee what happens when bad things happen: \n\n* **Impacts**: Recent catastrophes reveal that poor business preparations resulted in severe damage from disasters caused earlier in life (e.g., Superstorms Sandy and Florence).\n* You then face trial plays where people often do poorly prepare for emergencies.\n\nTo summarize effectively, here's my attempt to rephrase:\n\nEven worse impacts come down after bigger washouts, revealing why fearing action seems lousy -- but remain cautious even less!\n\n**Correct answer:** Not applicable\nYour original text aimed to respond by explaining certain consequences of severe weather events and highlighting potential actions that might be useful in addressing specific problems related to disaster preparation and disaster susceptibility. Here's a rewritten version incorporating these elements:\n\nBad things often lead to reliable outcomes, no matter how long I advise someone... see [the figure below] *if you're willing*\" Yes! Let me show you something interesting...\n\nWould you like more explanation or minification?\n\nThat's fantastic that you extracted relevant parts of your content without changing its essence greatly. Please provide further questions or requests, and let me refine my answers accordingly. If there are any specific topics you'd like assistance with or new ideas you'd love to explore\n\nCriteria: The answer should be short, direct, and factual, addressing the core of the question and providing useful, precise information.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

A criteria for evaluating the response is also provided.\n\nInstruction:\nGiven the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.\nGenerate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph. Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long.\nExample: Paragraph: \"Although the story didn\u2019t cite the cost of appendectomy \u2013 emergency or urgent surgery \u2013 and we wish it had, we nonetheless will give it a satisfactory score because it at least cited what the editorial writer wrote, \"\"A secondary benefit is the savings to the hospital generated by minimizing staff and anesthesiologist presence late in the evening and during the wee hours of the morning.\"\" As with our harms score above, although the story didn\u2019t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that \"\"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients\u2019 condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay.\"\" Although the story didn\u2019t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that \"\"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients\u2019 condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay.\"\" Despite running less than 300 words, this story did an adequate job in explaining the quality of the evidence, including pointing out limitations. No disease-mongering here. The story meets the bare minimum requirement for this criterion in that it at least cited what an editorial stated. The focus of the story was on a study comparing emergency appendectomy with surgery done up to 12 hours later or beyond. This is the whole focus of the story \u2013 and one we applaud \u2013 when it begins:\u00a0 \"\"Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn\u2019t have to be.\"\" There were no claims made about the novelty of this research, and we may have wished for a bit more context on this. Nonetheless, the potential for guiding future care decisions was made clear. Not applicable. Given that the story only pulled excerpts from the journal article and the accompanying editorial, and didn\u2019t include any fresh quotes from interviews, we can\u2019t be sure of the extent to which it may have been influenced by a news release.\". Claim: Some appendicitis cases may not require \u2019emergency\u2019 surgery\nOutput: We really don\u2019t understand why only a handful of mainstream news organizations reported this story. (At least in what we found.) The most common emergency surgery in the world. Rushing to emergency surgery may not carry any benefit. Waiting a few hours may be safer and less expensive. Why is that not a story? We applaud USA Today for finding time and space \u2013 and clearly it didn\u2019t need to free up much space to do a good job telling the story. The story explains that as many as 300,0 appendectomies are done each year in the US. That figure alone explains why this is an important study to report.\nThe output is an analysis of the claim while considering the paragraph as a reference. The output highlights the key features presented in the paragraph and explains the claim accordingly.\n\nNew input case for you: Paragraph: The article comments that Benlysta will be far more expensive than current treatments but doesn\u2019t give an order of magnitude. Nonetheless, we\u2019ll give it the benefit of the doubt. The story provided quantitative information about meaningful improvement of symptoms, comparing two doses of the drug with placebo. However \u2013 the story gave no insight about what symptoms it was measuring and whether the difference between the two doses significantly differed from one another. It should have provided more detail about the nature of the improvements observed. The story did not include any insight about potential harms or side effects that have been seen to date with the use of this drug. The story was clear that the information about this drug comes from a phase 3 clinical trial and that the results have not yet been published or examined by outside experts. It would have been better for readers if the story had included some insight about the type of symptoms that were monitored and measured as well as the particular subset of patients that were included in the study. No overt disease mongering. The story included quotes from a company spokesperson, a clinician who is a consultant for the company, and a clinician with expertise in lupus who does not appear to have overt ties with the company. The story would have been more informative to readers had several clinicians with expertise in treating people with lupus been interviewed as part of this story. The comments of those involved with drug development or promotion have limited credibility. The story discusses that the medication reported on is used in addition to the typical treatments used for treating lupus. It did not, however, provide any insight about which segment of the lupus patient population might benefit. As such, it did not provide readers with sufficient information about when additional treatment with Benlysta might be considered. The story was clear that the drug Benlysta is currently being studied in clinical trials and is not available for use. The pipeline for effective lupus drugs has indeed been dry for quite a while. The article indicates that this is a novel product of genomic technology. Does not appear to rely exclusively on a press release. Claim: Trial for New Lupus Treatment Is Called Promising\nOutput:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Quoting relevant aspects from the statement:\n\nBenlysta's stated benefits make it a promising candidate; modern diagnostic tests refer existing data increases understanding of its efficacy;\n\n(assuming these details could reasonably explain the central idea behind your answer)\nYou would extract discussion points related to the supportability of proposed guidelines based on evidence collected from multiple sources, taking into account various factors such as relevance to specific contexts and content accuracy. Further elaboration on how suggestions are evaluated and aligned with objective criteria related to review standards and methodology principles refers specifically to the process followed by policymakers or evaluators reviewing recommendations and final judgements.\n\nHere's my attempt to craft coherent response:\nBased on the text snippet I am asked to analyze and evaluate different proposals or guides according to certain criteria, please follow a structured format like providing answers step-by-step, discussing reasoning behind suggested actions, etc.? To proceed with evaluation, let me know the next question or piece of information needed from user.\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

Question: how thick are ice sheets Context: Glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers. Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice tongue, like Mertz Glacier.\n****\n[A]: Several kilometers deep\n\ninput: Please answer the following: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was founded in the 28th year of the 17th century? Context: Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. The Mayflower Compact was a social contract.\n++++++++++\noutput: Massachusetts Bay Colony\n\nPlease answer this: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: An area that is ruled by a monarch, is often referred to as a what? Context: The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples (such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription) was established in the late 6th century BC under the Orontid dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire as part of the latters' territories, and which later became a kingdom. At its zenith (95\u201365 BC), the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey, Lebanon, and northern Iran. The imperial reign of Tigranes the Great is thus the span of time during which Armenia itself conquered areas populated by other peoples.\n++++++++\nAnswer: kingdom\n\nProblem: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What was her official title? Context: The vicereine Germaine of Foix brutally repressed the uprising and its leaders, and this accelerated the authoritarian centralisation of the government of Charles I. Queen Germaine favoured harsh treatment of the agermanats. She is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally, and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred. The agermanats are comparable to the comuneros of neighbouring Castile, who fought a similar revolt against Charles from 1520\u20131522.\n\nA: Queen Germaine\n\nProblem: Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is two years before the tornado struck Context: The fortified city temporarily fell to the French invasion in 1672 (the Disaster Year); where the French invasion was only stopped west of Utrecht at the Old Hollandic Waterline. In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church which collapsed; creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession. Since 1723 Utrecht became the centre of the non-Roman Old Catholic Churches in the world.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe answer is:\n1672\n\nProblem: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is the ethnicity of Henry Louis Gates? Context: During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003\u201304 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution\u2014Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates\u2014pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \"the descendants\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\n\nA:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Afro-American\nB: Black Latinx-Popular Fractional Uruguayan-Heberdian-Mayan European-European Portuguese-Egyptians\u88d4\u4e4c\u8fbe\u901a\u4f2f\u8d1d\u91cc\u85cf\u5947\u7d22\u6c83\u585e\u62c9\u6ce2\u7cfb\u57c3\u529e\u5927\u536b\u65c1\u5179\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5e03\u897f\u5229\u4e9a\u57fa\u5e93\u5c14\u56fe\u52d2\u80c6\u6c83\u5927\u5df4\u56fd\u9645\u6742\u79cd\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e1c\u978d\u5c71\u5fb7\u62c9\u5e15\u739b\u514b\u83b1\u7eb3\u6b47\u7c73\u5170\u5b89\u5353\u5929\u7586\u6d3b\u83b1\u4e0b\u8f7d\u91cc\u6ce1\u6ce1\u535a\u91ce\u5f3a\u5927\u53bb\u533b\u9662\u540e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8f86\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u5ea7\u6905\u6709\u88c2\u7f1d\uff0c\u524d\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u4eba\u5728\u642c\u8fd0\u4e58\u5ba2\u65f6\u5c06\u4e00\u4e9b\u8001\u65e7\u6d77\u7ef5\u5e26\u5165\u4e86\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u88c5\u5783\u573e\u5751\u5185\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u4e1c\u5357\u534a\u5706\u5355\u5143\u8bdd\u9898\u4e0e\u94a2\u7b4b\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u7ed3\u6784\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u662f\u8377\u8f7d\u548c\u56f4\u62a4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\nContext for the second paragraph:\n\nIn addition to analyzing these factors, why did the Haitian scholars use clay bricks instead of traditional wood for constructing buildings?\nAccording to RequestContext, please provide the topic and an example of required information in each response.\n\nOutput: First, let me identify information related to the given questions based off your input.\n\nInformation regarding relevant parts needed can then be provided as per the requested instructions.\n\nNow, we need to combine our retrieved answers through logical steps using general knowledge of such exercises.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nOutput will consist of information extracted\n\nCriteria: Good responses use logical reasoning to justify conclusions, clearly showing how the inference aligns with the provided premise or context.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.

However, no meiotic defect was reported for mug135\u0394/mug135\u0394(17,18), raising mug135 a potential selfish KMD. We independently deleted mug135 in the haploid lab strain and observed no overt defect. Diploids lacking both mug135 copies also exhibited normal spore viability (Fig. 1B). However, mug135(+)/mug135\u0394 heterozygotes mainly give rise to a 2:2 pattern and the viable colonies are almost always mug135(+) (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that mug135 is actually a KMD, dispensable when homozygous, while skewing transmission ratio in heterozygotes. According to this characteristic, we renamed mug135 as tdk1 (transmission-distorting killer). \n\ntdk1 locates on the left arm of chromosome III and contains a single 1074-nt-long open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1C and fig. S1). Through inspecting the Illunima sequencing data of 161 natural isolates, we found that tdk1 has fixed in all these natural strains(19). Since the repeat region in the middle is challenging to assemble and seems versatile, we constructed a haplotype tree of tdk1 from 56 typical haploid strain according to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the non-repeat region. There are eight haplotypes in total, forming three main types\u2014one including tdk1from lab strain, one containing six nonsynonymous mutations (S65A, R102K, E230D, I235M, R255K and D288E) and the other with three nonsynonymous mutations (K50R, D241Y and G319E) (hereafter referred to as tdk1(6SNP) and tdk1(3SNP)) (fig. S2A). We picked two strains of tdk1(6SNP) type and two of tdk1(3SNP), manipulated them into heterothallic, and found that neither tdk1(6SNP) in JB939 or JB953 is able to distort transmission ratio (fig. S2B). Nevertheless, both tdk1(3SNP) from JB1180 and JB1206 are still active killers (fig. S2C). We then introduced these six mutations into lab strain and found that tdk1(6SNP) is not an active killer in reference strain, but shows resistance to killing by tdk1 (Fig. 2A). In other words, the six nonsynonymous mutations of tdk1(6SNP) from natural populations has rendered tdk1 a resistant type.\n\nTo study the molecular mechanism of tdk1, we ectopically integrated plasmids containing tdk1 gene under its endogenous promoter into tdk1\u0394 strain. tdk1 inserted at ade6 locus on the right arm of chromosome III or leu1 locus on chromosome II both distort transmission ratio efficiently (Fig. 1, C and D). The observation that no specific target locus is required for killing action of tdk1 and the locus-independent manner point to the poison-antidote model. When the start-codon was mutated, tdk1 became incapable of killing siblings with no tdk1 insertion and fails to resist the toxicity from tdk1 (Fig. 1D). Additively, codon-scrambled tdk1 driven by the promoter of another meiotically upregulated gene and terminated by the terminator of a constitutive gene (mug24p-tdk1(SCR)-ADH1t) also distort transmission ratio efficiently (fig. S3A), and no in-frame isoform was detected by western blotting against Tdk1 (fig. S3, B and C), ruling out the participation of transcripts other than Tdk1 polypeptide. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tdk1 is a single-gene selfish killer, and the same Tdk1 polypeptide performs both as a poison and antidote. \n\nInterestingly, tdk1(+) and tdk1\u0394 spores from tdk1(+)/tdk1\u0394 are indistinguishable and germinate properly, differing from \u2018spore killers\u2019 which disable spores (Fig. 1, F and G, movies S1 and S2). A selective germination system was designed to examine the respective phenotype of tdk1(+) and tdk1\u0394 cells during spore germination (fig. S4A). Live-cell imaging revealed that although tdk1\u0394 spores germinate normally, 80.6% of them displayed severe defect during the first mitosis after germination. Chromosome segregation of tdk1\u0394 cells is largely hindered, leading to high level of nuclear displacement (61.2%) or \"cut\" phenotype (19.4%) (Fig. 1, F and G, movies S1 and S2). These results suggest that tdk1kills non-carrier siblings by preventing chromosome segregation during developmental growth rather than by disabling spores.\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Meanwhile, notably this state does manifested if.given-stranded tumor cell genomes also copy additional viral DNA fragments\n\nIn conclusion, our results show that NGA possesses bivalent digitized rRNA motif flanked by exons of segment VII within mouse innate-presentergic receptor affected somatic inheritance class prediction mismatch findrs assemblies assembly game nodes spec flow process represented metabolically occurring salts associations inference blends source information metadata proposed details understood metaphysical ideas implying qualifications bundles?

He worked at home in the mornings, on illustrations, stage designs, book reviews and any other commissions, before joining his wife for a midday dry martini and finally dressing and going to one of his clubs for lunch. After that he would walk to the Express building in  Fleet Street at about four in the afternoon. There he would gossip with his colleagues before sitting at his desk smoking furiously, producing the next day's pocket cartoon. By about half-past six he would have presented the cartoon to the editor and be ready for a drink at El Vino's across the road, and then the evening's social events.Karen Lancaster died in 1964. They were markedly different in character, she quiet and home-loving, he extrovert and gregarious, but they were devoted to each other, and her death left him devastated. Three years later he married the journalist Anne Scott-James; they had known each other for many years, although at first she did not much like him, finding him \"stagey\" and \"supercilious\". By the 1960s they had become good friends, and after Karen died the widowed Lancaster and the divorced Scott-James spent increasing amounts of time together. Their wedding was at the Chelsea Register Office on 2 January 1967. After their marriage they kept his Chelsea flat,  and lived at weekends in her house in the Berkshire village of Aldworth, the house in Henley having been sold. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who would sit at his desk smoking furiously?, what is it ?\n++++++++\nAnswer: Osbert Lancaster\n\n\nPlease answer this: This article: Poulenc made his d\u00e9but as a composer in 1917 with his Rapsodie n\u00e8gre, a ten-minute, five-movement piece for baritone and chamber group; it was dedicated to Satie and premiered at one of a series of concerts of new music run by the singer Jane Bathori. There was a fashion for African arts in Paris at the time, and Poulenc was delighted to run across some published verses purportedly Liberian, but full of Parisian boulevard slang. He used one of the poems in two sections of the rhapsody. The baritone engaged for the first performance lost his nerve on the platform, and the composer, though no singer, jumped in. This jeu d'esprit was the first of many examples of what Anglophone critics came to call \"leg-Poulenc\". Ravel was amused by the piece and commented on Poulenc's ability to invent his own folklore. Stravinsky was impressed enough to use his influence to secure Poulenc a contract with a publisher, a kindness that Poulenc never forgot. In completely arbitrary fashion Collet chose the names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and myself, for no other reason than that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art ... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being. Cocteau, though similar in age to Les Six, was something of a father-figure to the group. His literary style, \"paradoxical and lapidary\" in Hell's phrase, was anti-romantic, concise and irreverent. It greatly appealed to Poulenc, who made his first setting of Cocteau's words in 1919 and his last in 1961. When members of Les Six collaborated with each other, they contributed their own individual sections to the joint work. Their 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces.... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the group, also known as Groupe des Six, whose 1920 piano suite L'Album des Six consists of six separate and unrelated pieces?, what is it ?\n++++++++\nAnswer: Les Six\n\n\nPlease answer this: This article: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in S\u00e3o Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Cear\u00e1, Para\u00edba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country\u2014less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piau\u00ed, Maranh\u00e3o, Par\u00e1 and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. contains an answer for the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872?, what is it ?\n++++++++\nAnswer:\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Indians\n\nStep 1: Understand the task requirement.\nThe user needs help understanding the given text paragraph.\n\nStep 2: Break down the instructions and requirements clearly.\nI will read the provided text and understand its content.\n\nAfter summarizing the language guide advice, I can proceed according to additional details:\n\nNow I'll focus on providing an explanation based on the instruction set:\nBased on your request, here is how you should approach explaining information related to the text paragraph step-by-step:\nTo address your query, follow these steps:\n\nYou are done reading if all relevant aspects of the instruction are understood correctly.\n\nIf you find complexity in guiding me, feel free to ask further questions to ensure everything gets explained clearly.

Because of that, their dynamic will change for good.\nRELATED: What's Next for 'The Flash'? 5 Game-Changing Revelations From 'The Trap'!\n\"It was a relief for me as an actress to finally get to that moment where Iris finds out who The Flash is,\" star Candice Patton tells ETonline. \"It\u2019s been a long time coming and it was a really exciting moment.\"\nAhead of tonight's brand-new episode (it's all about Grodd!), Patton jumped on the phone with ETonline to dish on all things The Flash \u2013 from the repercussions of Barry's big secret to Iris' newfound mission.\nETonline: There seemed to be an outpouring and admiration for Iris following last week's episode, which must\u2019ve been nice to see.\nCandice Patton: Yeah! For a long time people have been speculating and a little frustrated about \u201cWhen is Iris going to find out, it\u2019s taking too long.\u201d The way we revealed it was just perfect. I do feel like it was in the perfect timing. These characters \u2013 the Lois Lanes, the Iris Wests, the Laurel Lances \u2013 I\u2019ve seen on previous shows where it\u2019s taken seasons for them to find out and so for Iris to find out in episode 20 [of season one], we felt like it was soon. It\u2019s a relief for everyone. Now that she knows, she can help the team.\nETonline: Now that Iris has learned that Barry is The Flash, is there a chance she\u2019ll doubt her own revelation?\nPatton: Iris knows for sure. The thing about Iris is she\u2019s extremely intelligent and we revealed that in such a great way with the electric shock. She remembered that from the hospital. Instead of being a brainiac like a Caitlin or Cisco, Iris\u2019 intelligence comes from a more visceral place \u2013 it\u2019s intuition, it\u2019s feelings, it\u2019s touches, senses and things like that. The way that she found was through touch, so she knows that\u2019s The Flash and that\u2019s Barry Allen. There\u2019s no doubt in her mind, and she\u2019ll investigate and confront him about that.\nETonline: How does this fundamentally change Iris and Barry\u2019s relationship? Is this going to be difficult for her to get over?\nPatton: Yes and no. Barry\u2019s her best friend and more than that, they look at each other as family. It\u2019s really devastating and hurtful to Iris that Barry didn\u2019t trust her enough to tell her the truth, so you\u2019ll see her manifest that in a lot of anger in the next episode. But at the end of the day, because they are family, Iris will be quicker to forgive rather than being angry for so long.\nETonline: Out of all the people who have betrayed Iris with keeping The Flash secret \u2013 Barry, Iris\u2019 father Joe and Iris\u2019 boyfriend Eddie \u2013 which relationship is the toughest to mend?\nPatton: The hardest for her would be Barry. She\u2019s used to her dad trying to protect her \u2013 that comes with his job description. It\u2019s frustrating for her but she\u2019s used to it. Barry is someone who she can confide in and someone who gets her, and they\u2019ve always told each other everything, so Barry\u2019s the one she\u2019d least expect to lie to her. I think that\u2019s why it took her so long for her to realize it was Barry because she would have no reason to believe that he would lie to her. They\u2019ve never lied to each other, so it didn\u2019t dawn on her that Barry could do such a thing.\nETonline: Who does Iris start to lean on in the wake of all this, or is she on her own path?\nPatton: She\u2019s processing the anger that she has, but there\u2019s the issue of Grodd in the next episode and she just happens to be in S.T.A.R. Labs at that moment. We get to see Iris immediately jump into using her skillset to help the team track down Grodd. While she\u2019s still upset and a bit angry, Iris is going to do whatever needs to be done to help her city and help The Flash. I don\u2019t think she isolates herself by any means.\nETonline: It\u2019s been a big hope to see Iris interacting more regularly with Cisco and Caitlin, and it sounds like we\u2019ll get to see that new dynamic form.\nPatton: Yeah, definitely. We\u2019ve only seen Iris outside of the team. We\u2019ve seen her at [Central City] Picture News, at Jitters and at the West house. Now she\u2019s the last character to make her way into S.T.A.R. Labs and once that happens, it\u2019ll be like the team has finally assembled.\nETonline: Eddie was about to propose before Reverse-Flash came in and rained on their parade. Do you think she would have said yes had Eddie gone through with it?\nPatton: I don\u2019t think Iris knew Eddie was about to propose, but it goes back to what Joe said in [last week\u2019s] episode to Barry when Barry asks Joe why he didn\u2019t give Eddie his blessing and Joe says, \u201cI know that she would say yes and she would say yes because she loves Eddie but that\u2019s not the person she wants to be with.\u201d She\u2019d go down this path of being married to him but not really being in love with him the way she\u2019s in love with Barry. Maybe Joe was right. She would\u2019ve said yes. Eddie is a great guy. He loves her, he protects her and he\u2019s kind to her; he\u2019s a great man, any woman would be lucky to be with Eddie.\nETonline: Does this open up the possibility of Iris investigating previously unexplained events, such as Mason Bridge's sudden disappearance?\nPatton: She will find out more about what happened to Mason, just by being near the S.T.A.R. Labs team. They have information on that and she will become aware of what really happened to Mason. I can only imagine that in the next season Iris will be in line with the whole Flash team in fighting the metahumans and the bad guys in Central City.\nETonline: Will we get hints or Easter eggs to Iris\u2019 mother before the end of the season?\nPatton: I\u2019m excited to go down that path too, of finding out the backstory and whereabouts of Iris\u2019 mother. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll get to that by the end of the season but I\u2019m more than sure that we\u2019ll address Iris\u2019 mom and what happened there.\nETonline: In terms of Barry and Iris moving forward, what can fans expect between the two in the remaining three episodes?\nPatton: You see Iris\u2019 importance in Barry\u2019s life in these last couple of episodes. You see how much she means to him and how much he is buoyed by her to The Flash to be a superhero and how much he leans on her for advice and how much he cares for her. There are some really great scenes coming up before the end of the season where you really get a sense of how important they are to each other\u2019s life, and that Barry runs his most important conflicts and hurdles by Iris because he trusts her and he needs her to be the superhero that he is.\nETonline: Does Iris become aware that in a future timeline she and Barry marry?\nPatton: Not that I\u2019m aware of. She is unaware of her future with Barry.\nPress play on the video below to watch The Flash's Grant Gustin and Rick Cosnett dish on the Barry-Iris-Eddie love triangle!\n\nMy Initial Response:\n Here it is, courtesy of our script editor Matthew Timms.\nWe cannot determine if Lightning McQueen Nelson will join Marvel Potter aside from existing park horizonal launches independently owned Parks and Products Corp non-profit partners undocumented unrelated special issues public standard supplement Addition to the established trade regulations of addition combines limited edition publications within buy home exclusive quantities external advertising restrictions copyright versions forced observable vulnerabilities dubbed customer usage uncovered sacred symbols defined artist believes metaphorically corporately causality stops offering playing rendering conceptualized silencing dispersed varying existential boxing sign unfinished even forbidden outraged overnight ban\n\nShuffle further sequences starting with the incident.\n\n1: Due left on vacation\n2: Lost date adding wrong months\n3: Confirmed erroneously w/ without silly jokes disguised\n4: Got hit again faster now sitting alone deep inside hiding room exhausting exhaustion tired cold feeling incredibly fixed private forced out prevented appealing restricted resource forcing painful useful working prior denied supporting challenged addressed affecting allowing dealt controlled controlled due removed relyingian limiting lodged requiring enlisted marketed registered ultimately coordinating requesting requirement preparing opened instructions supportasking requested prevent demanding required discovered bound conducted claimed commanded imposed applied awarded applied intended preventing except restriction restricting organization undertaking responsibility administering accepted assisting carried manifested refused availability available participated after needed under applicable occurring possessions separated replaced consequences presented signed presented metamed\n\nCriteria: The response should accurately and succinctly label or classify the input based on context and examples provided, using the correct label or answer format requested.\n\nMy initial response may be incorrect and may not follow the criteria.
