The story revolves around the advertising world and the marketing of a beer product.\\n\\nThe plot follows an advertising executive named B.D. Tucker (played by Loretta Swit) who is given the challenge of increasing sales for a failing beer brand called Norbecker. In an attempt to create a groundbreaking advertising campaign, she discovers a group of average, beer-loving guys in a bar, consisting of Merle (William Russ), Frankie (Saul Stein), and Elliot (David Alan Grier). Tucker hires them as the new faces of Norbecker beer, believing their authenticity will appeal to the brand\\'s target demographic.\\n\\nThe campaign becomes an instant hit as viewers connect with the trio\\'s genuine love for beer and their blue-collar humor. However, the sudden fame goes to the men\\'s heads, and they become difficult to manage. Meanwhile, rival beer companies plot to sabotage the campaign and bring down Norbecker.\\n\\nThe film is a satire of the advertising industry and the lengths that companies will go to in order to sell their products to consumers. With comical performances and a unique premise, \"Beer\" provides an entertaining look into the world of marketing, consumer culture, and the consequences of fame.'}"

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  and the situation: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties.

      "35. Over the past three years insurers have seen record levels of catastrophe claims. To take just one event, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami was the costliest natural catastrophe of the past thirty years.\n",
      "A recurring problem for businesses affected by recent catastrophic events was supply chain disruption. Events, such as those that occurred in 2011, like the earthquake in Japan and the Thai floods were a real eye-opener for companies dependent on suppliers. And it’s fair to say that in some cases, the exposures and impact were significantly higher than either businesses or insurers expected.\n",
      "A common failure was a lack of properly developed business continuity plans, including for example a list of alternative suppliers. Many companies had only little knowledge of their supply chains and were caught by surprise after the events. We also found that our clients in the electrical and manufacturing industries in both the US and Asia are (for understandable reasons) reluctant to share their trade secrets and invest in agreements with multiple suppliers, so they use a limited pool.\n",
      "However, recent catastrophic events showed how risky it is to rely on a few suppliers, many of which were left unable to trade. Consequently we are now finding that our policy holders are widening their supply chain, which will put them in a much stronger position in the case of future events.\n",
      "Superstorm Sandy also showed that businesses should balance the level of supplies held on their own premises carefully. On hearing about the impending storm, one of our clients, a retailer, overrode an automatic stock ordering system to postpone the next delivery. This was a really smart move - they anticipated that stores would be closed and that stock being delivered in the midst of the crisis could be damaged.\n",
      "On the flipside, other businesses should think about whether to hold more of their own supplies. Some of our clients that produce electrical goods are now keeping some key materials onsite, which will allow them to continue operating for a known period of time if their supply chain is interrupted.\n",
      "Lastly, businesses must ensure they are insured properly against supply chain interruption. A key problem is that insurers want to know which companies are in the supply chain, including the suppliers of the suppliers. That way we can measure the exposure, whether it’s earthquakes or hurricanes and so on. But while clients are getting better at providing this information, supply chains tend to change continually, so keeping up remains a challenge for both us and our clients– we all need to focus more on this. The insurance company’s risk engineering team can help with evaluating the supply chain risks and in developing pre-emergency plans.\n",
      "Recent catastrophes have also shown starkly that any measures taken to protect property from physical damage must actually go far enough. During this year’s Central European floods we saw some good examples in Dresden and Prague of excellent pre-emergency planning. Previously, in the 2002 floods, one of our clients suffered a significant loss because their building is right next to a river. They since invested around $1m in building flood defences around the site. This year was the first test for the defences and it proved that their investment has paid off.\n",
      "We also had clients who were properly prepared enabling them to avoid water damage to their property. Unfortunately they were cut off from their suppliers and clients due to disruption of public infrastructure.\n",
      "Others were not as well prepared to prevent damage from occurring. For instance, a number of businesses in Lower Manhattan, following previous storms, had stored important documents and valuables in vaults ahead of Sandy. Unfortunately these vaults were inadequate, so the water came in anyway. As a result, these businesses suffered to a greater extent than others.\n",
      "During the Thai floods the picture was mixed. Government warnings of an impending flood helped many shops avoid losses because they simply moved stock to higher levels. However, businesses with heavier plant on the ground floor were unable to take similar measures. With the water remaining at around two metres deep in many areas for eight weeks, much plant and high tech equipment was destroyed.\n",
      "Clients can start to address these issues by calling on their insurers’ risk engineering team for advice on protecting properties.\n",
      "Superstorm Sandy revealed that a number of our clients had impressively robust business continuity plans. Our IT and communications clients had particularly good emergency plans. Their IT systems switched over automatically to alternative back-up systems that meant their operations – many of which are global – continued uninterrupted.\n",
      "These clients also had good business continuity plans for their physical offices. For example, some had pre-arranged agreements with clean-up companies so they were at the front of the queue for their services. This meant they were back on their feet faster than competitors.\n",
      "Finally, services companies assisting with immediate business recovery should also be handled with care. In the aftermath of Sandy, opportunists supplied urgently needed equipment like power generators for vastly inflated fees – a practice known as “price-gouging”. Insurers can help clients to get a reasonable price for such services based on knowledge of industry standards. This potentially could save clients anything from hundreds to millions of dollars.\n",
      "Of course, you can never fully protect a business from a major loss event. However, the past three years have shown that good risk management can make a real difference to how severely you are impacted by natural catastrophes. What are some examples of good pre-emergency planning that were demonstrated during recent natural catastrophes, and how can businesses work with insurers to ensure they are taking appropriate steps to protect their physical properties and maintain business continuity in the event of a major loss event?\n",

      "61. When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of the story, the author probably: Options:  A. not enough information  B. doesn't try to accept criticism at work  C. tries to accept criticism at work  D. argues about criticism when given it at work\n",

      "Sentence: In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: \"I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ...\" The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather. \n",

Movie plot title: Manos: The Hands of Fate Movie plot: While on a road trip near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie, and their dog, Peppy, search for the \"Valley Lodge.\" Michael and his family finally reach a house which is tended by the bizarre, satyr-like Torgo, who takes care of the house \"while the Master is away.\" Michael and Margaret ask Torgo for directions to Valley Lodge; Torgo simply replies that there is no place like that around here. With this information, Michael asks Torgo to let him and his family stay the night, despite objections from both Torgo and Margaret.Inside the home, the family sees a disturbing painting of a dark, malevolent-looking man and a black dog with glowing eyes; the man it depicts is the Master. Margaret becomes frightened upon hearing an ominous howl; Michael investigates, retrieving a flashlight and revolver from his car, and later finds Peppy lying dead on the ground. Torgo reveals his attraction to Margaret and tells her that, although she is doomed to become yet another bride of The Master, he intends to keep her for himself. Margaret threatens to tell Michael of Torgo's advances, but Torgo convinces her not to say anything to her husband by promising to protect her. Michael returns, unable to start the car. With the revelation that there is no phone in the house, the family reluctantly decides to stay the night.Michael and Margaret stumble upon \"The Master\" and several women dressed in translucent nightgowns and later revealed to be his wives. They are all asleep. Torgo uses a stick to knock out Michael, and then ties Michael to a pole, after dragging him to it, and The Master suddenly comes to life. His wives also awaken, and a short argument over the fate of the family ensues. The Master decides he must sacrifice Torgo and his first wife to the film's mysterious deity and namesake, \"Manos.\" When The Master leaves, his wives engage in further argument that soon degenerates into a fight, and the women wrestle in the sand.Torgo succumbs to what appears to be a hypnotic spell by The Master.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Fifteen disparate African American men board a bus in Los Angeles bound for Washington, D.C., where they plan on attending the Million Man March. Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is an openly racist and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a police officer, is the sole biracial man on the bus; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to confrontations; the only topic of unity is the O.J. Simpson trial, with the men agreeing that, while Simpson is probably guilty, his acquittal is justified as his victims were a white woman and a Jew. Peace is kept through the various verbal arguments and physical altercations that occur by Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group. Jeremiah, an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life by embracing his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by a ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. Several of the passengers harass Rick with antisemitic remarks and jokes; Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan. George, himself a bus driver, accuses Rick of racism, but...\n",

Beware the dealer’s guiding hand And grasp it with misgiving; He knows that you know nothing, and That’s how he makes his living.

Mistrust all articles on Art And critic’s expositions; From dilettantes stay apart, And shy at exhibitions.

      "While collecting pine cones, Pooh accidentally stumbles, and several go into a little river, over which spans a wooden bridge.As Pooh notes that the pine cones seem to almost race each other, the game is then dubbed 'Pooh Sticks.' Though in future races, twigs are substituted for pine cones.During one game, Rabbit, Pooh, Piglet and Roo are surprised when Eeyore floats through the middle of their 'Pooh Sticks' game. When asked how he ended up in the river, Eeyore claims he was 'bounced.' Given that word, there seems to be only one creature that could have done it: Tigger.The group go to Tigger to discuss this, but Tigger denies he 'bounced' Eeyore. It is then that the story's narrator interjects, and shows the characters that Tigger is lying. Tigger claims it was just a joke, and bounces off. Eeyore trudges off sadly, leading some to wonder if something is troubling him.Pooh finds him in his 'gloomy spot,' where Eeyore proclaims that today is his Birthday. Wanting to make him feel better, Pooh rushes off and tells the others about Eeyore's birthday. Pooh decides to give Eeyore a pot of honey for a gift. However, he soon ends up eating all the honey, and instead decides to give Eeyore the honey pot, claiming it as a 'useful pot.'Piglet decides to give Eeyore a balloon, but accidentally pops it. However, Eeyore is still pleased with it, notably when it fits perfectly in Pooh's 'useful pot.'Shortly afterward, Christopher Robin holds a birthday party for Eeyore, but the fun doesn't last long as Tigger shows up, unannounced and uninvited. To try and clear up the awkward moment, Christopher Robin suggests that everyone play a game of 'Pooh Sticks.'During the game, Eeyore as a first-time player, wins moreso than everyone else, but Tigger doesn't win one game. As everyone parts, Eeyore notices Tigger is dejected over not winning. Eeyore approaches Tigger, and cheerfully explains that he'll tell him his secret for winning at 'Pooh Sticks,' which cheers up Tigger.The short ends with Christopher Robin, Pooh, and Piglet standing on the bridge, looking around the 100-acre wood., Question: Where did the game \"Pooh Sticks\" get its name?\n",

Two thirds of the latter was driven by a high carryover at the start of the year. In Q4, household spending decreased by -0.1% q/q. This weakness was the result of several factors, such as the second oil price spike (in October, after May), difficulties in the automotive sector (partly driven by new homol­o­gation rules and their impact on German carmakers) and the yellow vest blockades. The missing house­hold spending was pervasive in Q4, since residential investment deteriorated to +0% y/y (+5.1% in Q4 2017) and private consumption to +0.6% y/y (+1% y/y). As a result, manufacturers had to stabilize their output in Q4 2018 (+0.1% q/q) and construction output posted a double dip decline (-0.1% in Q4 after -0.2% in Q1). In 2019, current spending is expected to recover (purchasing power should increase by +2%) and push GDP growth to +1.2%, but increased unemployment (9.2%) will weigh on residential and durable goods spending of households.\n",

A competing team called Omega did research on the human genome. Team Omega lost.  and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

      "Several hundred beef producers from Washington, Brazos, Austin, Burleson, Fayette, Harris, Lee and Waller counties took part in the day-long program hosted by the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service and surrounding beef and forage county committees.\n",
      "Dr. Dan Hale, AgriLife Extension meat specialist, discussed carcass value and what cattle order buyers are looking for. He said there could be as many as nine order buyers at an auction ring looking to fill specific orders.\n",
      "He said it’s important to get as many buyers in attendance to bid on your cattle to fill their orders.\n",
      "“You do that by making sure your calves you are marketing fit their orders,” he said.\n",
      "Hale said the buyers are given orders every week before they go to the auction and may have as many as 20 orders to fill.\n",
      "Hale said the longer you can feed those animals before they start getting into the rapid fattening phase of their life, and the more muscular they are, the faster they grow.\n",
      "“The order buyer is looking at seeing how long they will they grow in the feedyard or on grass before they start getting really fat,” he said. “This is also why lighter-weight calves often bring higher prices per hundredweight, as lighter cattle will be able to spend more time as a stocker calf and as a feeder calf before they become finished in the feedyard.\n",
      "Hale said order buyers are also looking at gender. He said heifers start the fattening phase of their lives much sooner than steers and that is the reason prices paid for them are often less than comparable steers.\n",
      "Hale said producers should consider adding value to their calves. This can be achieved by implementing programs such as the VAC 45 program, also known as the Value Added Calf program, where calves are weaned 45 days before they are sold. They also receive two sets of booster vaccines to enhance their immunity to disease and sickness.\n",
      "The buyers of VAC 45 calves find them to more easily attain their genetic potential, have an enhanced immune system, are more predictable in their feedyard performance, and reduce the use of antibiotics.\n",
      "Castrating bull calves also adds value, said Dr. Joe Paschal, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service livestock specialist, Corpus Christi. Paschal and Dr. Helen Philips of Philips Veterinary Hospital in Brenham provided a live chute-side demonstration.\n",
      "Phillips urged producers to develop a herd health plan with their veterinarian, and both she and Paschal discussed proper vaccinations to prevent diseases such as blackleg and redwater from causing death to valuable calves. They also discussed practices such as ear notching to help ranchers identify the pasture in which calves have received a round of vaccinations.\n",
      "“There are practices that can add value to your calves, whether it’s sticking an ear tag in their ear, putting a notch in the ear, blackleg vaccination or castrating bull calves at a young age. All of this adds value to those calves and you will be compensated when you market those calves,” Paschal said.\n",

After meeting up with his brother Mycroft at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with Gypsy fortune-teller Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Voicing his respect for Holmes' perseverance, Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler. Holmes subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them anyway. Holmes vengefully vows to defeat him. Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft.

Question: how thick are ice sheets Context: Glacial bodies larger than 50,000 km2 (19,000 sq mi) are called ice sheets or continental glaciers. Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice tongue, like Mertz Glacier.\n",

Context: Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies. In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement. Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India. In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers. These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. The Mayflower Compact was a social contract.\n",

At its zenith (95–65 BC), the state extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey, Lebanon, and northern Iran.

In 1674, only two years after the French left, the centre of Utrecht was struck by a tornado. The halt to building before construction of flying buttresses in the 15th century now proved to be the undoing of the central section of the cathedral of St Martin church which collapsed; creating the current Dom square between the tower and choir. In 1713, Utrecht hosted one of the first international peace negotiations when the Treaty of Utrecht settled the War of the Spanish Succession.

Context: During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \"the descendants\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\n",

In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called \"found photographs\"--a loose term given to everything from discarded  prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes \"basically everything is worth looking at\", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion   found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper  an angry note intended for some else: \"Why's your car HERE at HER place?\" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated  , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating. \n",
